Methods We studied the effects of predicted changes in California’s rainy season for storage and stabilization mechanisms of soil organic matter (SOM). In a controlled and replicated experiment, we amended rainfall over large plots of natural grassland in accordance with alternative scenarios of future climate change. Results We found that increases in annual rainfall have important consequences for soil carbon (C) storage, but that the strength and even direction of these effects depend critically on seasonal timing. Additional rainfall during the winter rainy season led to C loss from soil while additions after the typical rainy season increased soil C content. Analysis of MIneral-Organic Matter (OM) associations reveals a potentially powerful mechanism underlying this difference: increased winter rainfall greatly diminished the role of Fe and Al oxides in SOM stabilization. Dithionite extractable crystalline Fe oxides explained more than 35% of the variability in C storage under ambient control and extended spring rainfall conditions, compared to less than 0.01% under increased winter rainfall. Likewise, poorly crystalline Fe and Al oxides explained more than 25 and 40% of the variability in C storage in the control and extended spring rainfall treatments, respectively, but less than 5% in the increased winter rainfall treatment. Conclusions Increases in annual precipitation identical in amount but at three-month offsets produced opposite effects on soil C storage. Such clear differences in the amount and chemical composition of SOM, and in the vertical distribution of oxides in the soil profile in response to treatment timing carry important implications for the C sequestration trajectory of this ecosystem.",9/1/2012,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,1/19/2013 7:20,371-383,,2-Jan,358,,Plant Soil,,,,,,,,en,,,,,link.springer.com,,,,,,,Changes in rainfall; Ecology; MIneral-Organic Matter (OM) associations; Mechanisms of SOM stabilization; Plant Physiology; Plant Sciences; Soil Science & Conservation; Soil carbon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigate the effect of short-term (days) soil environmental condition on microbial community structure and composition during a natural wetting and drying cycle. Soil samples were collected from a meadow in Northern California at four time points after the first two rainfall events of the rainy season. We used the 16S rRNA microarrays (PhyloChip) to track changes in bacterial and archaeal community composition. Microbial communities at time points one and three were significantly different than communities at time points two and four. Based on ordination analysis, available carbon, soil moisture and temperature explained most of the variation in community structure. For the first time, a complementary and more comprehensive approach using linear regression (LR) and generalized logical networks (GLN) were used to identify linear and non-linear associations among environmental variables and with the relative abundance of sub-families. Changes in soil moisture and available carbon were correlated with the relative abundance of many Phyla. Only the phylum Actinobacteria showed a lineage specific relationship to soil moisture but not to carbon or nitrogen. The results indicate that use of high taxonomic rank in correlations with nutritional indicators might obscure divergent sub-family-level responses to environmental parameters. An important implication of this research is that there is short-term variation in microbial community composition driven in part by rainfall fluctuation that may not be evident in long-term studies with coarser time resolution.",8/17/2012,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,1/19/2013 7:26,,,,,,Appl.

The method which preserves sample integrity of dissolved trace metals and major ions for month-long periods employs a gravitational filtration system (GFS) that separates dissolved and particulate phases as samples are collected. The key elements of GFS are (1) a modified ?air-outlet? filter holder to maximize filtration rate and thus minimize filtration artifacts; and (2) the direct delivery of filtrate to dedicated bottle sets for specific analytes. Depth and screen filter types were evaluated with depth filters showing best performance. GFS performance is validated using ground, stream, and estuary waters. Over 30 days of storage, samples with GFS treatment had average recoveries of 95 ± 19% and 105 ± 7% of Fe and Mn, respectively; without GFS treatment, average recoveries were only 16% and 18%.

Native species in these ecosystems have evolved with predictable annual flood-drought cycles; thus, their likelihood of persistence may decrease in response to disruption of the seasonal synchrony between stable low-flow conditions and reproduction. We evaluated whether altered flow regimes affected 2 native frogs in California and Oregon (U.S.A.) at 4 spatial and temporal extents. We examined changes in species distribution over approximately 50 years, current population density in 11 regulated and 16 unregulated rivers, temporal trends in abundance among populations occupying rivers with different hydrologic histories, and within-year patterns of survival relative to seasonal hydrology. The foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii), which breeds only in flowing water, is more likely to be absent downstream of large dams than in free-flowing rivers, and breeding populations are on average 5 times smaller in regulated rivers than in unregulated rivers. Time series data (range = 8 − 19 years) from 5 populations of yellow-legged frogs and 2 populations of California red-legged frogs (R. draytonii) across a gradient of natural to highly artificial timing and magnitude of flooding indicate that variability of flows in spring and summer is strongly correlated with high mortality of early life stages and subsequent decreases in densities of adult females. Flow management that better mimics natural flow timing is likely to promote persistence of these species and others with similar phenology.",2012,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,1/19/2013 7:36,513–524,,3,26,,,,,,,,,,en,©2012 Society for Conservation Biology,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,Rana boylii; Rana draytonii; declinaciones de anfibios; energía hidroeléctrica; flujos en pulsaciones; régimen de flujo natural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The volume of flow, timing and ramping rate of spring spills, and magnitude of aseasonal pulsed flows have potentially negative effects on the early life stages of amphibians, such as the Foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii). Two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling is one method to evaluate potential effects of flow variation on frog egg masses and tadpoles. We explored the usefulness of this technique by modeling habitat suitability under several pulsed flow scenarios in two river reaches in northern California, USA. We conducted analyses beyond simple weighted usable area calculations, such as quantifying the risk of scour or stranding, in order to quantify potential loss under different flow scenarios. The modeling results provided information on potential susceptibility to flow fluctuations as well as the influence of channel morphology on habitat suitability. Under each flow scenario, low percentages of suitable habitat remained suitable or were ‘buffered’ from the pulse, creating high potential for scour of egg masses or tadpoles. However, due to differences in channel morphologies, the wide, shallow study site provided 2-3 times the buffering capacity of the entrenched study site.Additional analyses suggested that limited buffering capacity and lack of connectivity between suitable egg mass and tadpole habitats may explain why some hydraulically suitable habitats are unoccupied. This type of model-based analysis would be useful for managing foothill yellow-legged frogs or similar aquatic species in regulated river systems.

We conducted field measurements in Minnehaha Creek, MN (44o56'N, 93o28'W), to quantify the spatial and temporal variabilities of DO concentrations and, consequently, evaluated the estimates of NP. Dimensionless analysis of DO mass balance revealed the dominance of local photosynthesis over respiration, advection, re-aeration, and dispersion along the studied reach. Two alternative estimation methods of stream metabolism provided similar estimates of NP with 0.65 > kaTa > 0.17 within the studied reach where ka is the re-aeration rate and Ta is the water parcel average travel time. The spatial variability of DO change along the creek revealed an average length scale of 10 m over which DO exhibited significant autocorrelation.

Light-limited productivity increases as channels widen downstream. Time windows for growth, however, shrink as discharge increases, substrate particle size decreases, and the frequency of flood-driven bed mobilization increases downstream. Mediterranean rivers are periodically reset by hydrologic events with somewhat predictable timing. Typically, a rainy winter with high river discharge is followed by summer drought with little or no rainfall and slowly declining river flow. The magnitude and timing of winter floods and severity of subsequent summer drought can vary considerably from year to year, however. Episodic scouring floods or prolonged periods of drought are experienced as disturbances, stressors, or opportunities by river biota. The timing, duration, and intensity of these hydrologic controls affect performances of individuals, distribution and abundances of populations, and outcomes and consequences of species interactions. These interactions in turn determine how river food webs will assemble, develop, and reconfigure after disturbance. We discuss how spatial variation in solar radiation and spatial and temporal variations in disturbance affects river food webs under Mediterranean climate seasonality, focusing primarily on long-term observations in the Eel River of northwestern California, USA.",11/1/2013,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/18/2022 16:21,119-136,,1,719,,Hydrobiologia,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are centers of research, conservation, education, and public outreach, often embedded in natural environments that range from remote to densely populated urban locations. Because they lack traditional university departmental boundaries, researchers at field stations have the opportunity to converge their science disciplines in ways that can change careers and entire fields of inquiry. Field stations provide physical space for immersive research, hands-on learning, and new collaborations that are otherwise hard to achieve in the everyday bustle of research and teaching lives on campus. But the separation from university campuses that allows creativity to flourish also creates challenges. Sometimes, field stations are viewed as remote outposts and are overlooked because they tend to be away from population centers and their home institutions. This view is exacerbated by the lack of empirical evidence that can be used to demonstrate their value to science and society. Enhancing the Value and Sustainability of Field Stations and Marine Laboratories in the 21st Century summarizes field stations' value to science, education, and outreach and evaluates their contributions to research, innovation, and education. This report suggests strategies to meet future research, education, outreach, infrastructure, funding, and logistical needs of field stations. Today's technologies - such as streaming data, remote sensing, robot-driven monitoring, automated DNA sequencing, and nanoparticle environmental sensors - provide means for field stations to retain their special connection to nature and still interact with the rest of the world in ways that can fuel breakthroughs in the environmental, physical, natural, and social sciences. The intellectual and natural capital of today's field stations present a solid platform, but many need enhancements of infrastructure and dynamic leadership if they are to meet the challenges of the complex problems facing the world.

Here we propose a quantitative model to predict the vertical extent of weathered rock underlying soil-mantled hillslopes. We hypothesize that once fresh bedrock, saturated with nearly stagnant fluid, is advected into the near surface through uplift and erosion, channel incision produces a lateral head gradient within the fresh bedrock inducing drainage toward the channel. Drainage of the fresh bedrock causes weathering through drying and permits the introduction of atmospheric and biotically controlled acids and oxidants such that the boundary between weathered and unweathered bedrock is set by the uppermost elevation of undrained fresh bedrock, Zb. The slow drainage of fresh bedrock exerts a “bottom up” control on the advance of the weathering front. The thickness of the weathered zone is calculated as the difference between the predicted topographic surface profile (driven by erosion) and the predicted groundwater profile (driven by drainage of fresh bedrock). For the steady-state, soil-mantled case, a coupled analytical solution arises in which both profiles are driven by channel incision. The model predicts a thickening of the weathered zone upslope and, consequently, a progressive upslope increase in the residence time of bedrock in the weathered zone. Two nondimensional numbers corresponding to the mean hillslope gradient and mean groundwater-table gradient emerge and their ratio defines the proportion of the hillslope relief that is unweathered.

A contributing and supporting factor to this evolution is the emergence over the last two decades of technologies able to acquire high resolution topography (HRT) (meter and sub-meter resolution) data. Landscape features can now be captured at an appropriately fine spatial resolution at which surface processes operate; this has revolutionized the way we study Earth-surface processes. The wealth of information contained in HRT also presents considerable challenges. For example, selection of the most appropriate type of HRT data for a given application is not trivial. No definitive approach exists for identifying and filtering erroneous or unwanted data, yet inappropriate filtering can create artifacts or eliminate/distort critical features. Estimates of errors and uncertainty are often poorly defined and typically fail to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the dataset, which may introduce bias or error for many analyses. For ease of use, gridded products are typically preferred rather than the more information-rich point cloud representations. Thus many users take advantage of only a fraction of the available data, which has furthermore been subjected to a series of operations often not known or investigated by the user. Lastly, standard HRT analysis work-flows are yet to be established for many popular HRT operations, which has contributed to the limited use of point cloud data. In this review, we identify key research questions relevant to the Earth-surface processes community within the theme of mass and energy transfer across landscapes and offer guidance on how to identify the most appropriate topographic data type for the analysis of interest. We describe the operations commonly performed from raw data to raster products and we identify key considerations and suggest appropriate work-flows for each, pointing to useful resources and available tools. Future research directions should stimulate further development of tools that take advantage of the wealth of information contained in the HRT data and address the present and upcoming research needs such as the ability to filter out unwanted data, compute spatially variable estimates of uncertainty and perform multi-scale analyses. While we focus primarily on HRT applications for mass and energy transfer, we envision this review to be relevant beyond the Earth-surface processes community for a much broader range of applications involving the analysis of HRT.",9/1/2015,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/17/2022 18:07,174-193,,,148,,Earth-Science Reviews,Analyzing high resolution topography for advancing the understanding of mass and energy transfer through landscapes,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Bathymetry; Change detection; Filtering; Geomorphic features; IfSAR; InSAR; Lidar; Point cloud; Structure from Motion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the importance of these seasonally dry ecosystems (SDEs) for the global carbon cycling and in providing ecosystem services, a unifying ecohydrological framework to interpret the effects of climatic variability on SDEs is still lacking. A synthesis of existing data about plant functional adaptations in SDEs, covering some 400 species, shows that leaf phenological variations, rather than physiological traits, provide the dominant control on plant-water-carbon interactions. Motivated by this result, the combined implications of leaf phenology and climatic variability on plant water use strategies are here explored with a minimalist model of the coupled soil water and plant carbon balances. The analyses are extended to five locations with different hydroclimatic forcing, spanning seasonally dry tropical climates (without temperature seasonality) and Mediterranean climates (exhibiting out of phase seasonal patterns of rainfall and temperature). The most beneficial leaf phenology in terms of carbon uptake depends on the climatic regime: evergreen species are favoured by short dry seasons or access to persistent water stores, whereas high inter-annual variability of rainy season duration favours the coexistence of multiple drought-deciduous phenological strategies. We conclude that drought-deciduousness may provide a competitive advantage in face of predicted declines in rainfall totals, while reduced seasonality and access to deep water stores may favour evergreen species.

His scientific legacy grew from the discovery of a link between top-down forcing and species diversity, a breakthrough that led to the ideas of both keystone species and trophic cascades, and to our early understanding of the mosaic nature of biological communities, causes of zonation across physical gradients, and the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis of species diversity.

Here we follow rainfall through a thick (up to 25m) vadose zone of soil, saprolite, and weathered bedrock mostly composed of argillite, and underlying a steep (32°) forested hillslope. We discover a persistent structured heterogeneity of water isotopes inside the hillslope. Summer dry season causes evaporative enrichment of the soil, but not in the saprolite and weathered bedrock. In winter, the mobile water, generated by successive rainstorms with widely varying isotopic composition, mixes in the vadose zone, elevating soil and rock moisture content, and eventually recharging the groundwater with isotopically invariant water similar to the seasonally averaged rainfall. Yet throughout the winter the less mobile winter soil and rock moisture remains relatively light, and water extracted from the interior of argillite lies well to the left of the local meteoric water line. This persistently light composition of soil and rock moisture and the deviation from average meteoric values suggest that subsurface fractionation, or the inheritance of paleo-meteoric rock moisture associated with rock uplift may lead to large enduring isotopic differences between high and low mobility water. These differences suggest that the use of water isotopes as tracers must consider the possibility of subsurface isotopic evolution and the influence of exchange with more tightly held water.",2016,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/17/2022 18:06,164-189,,1,52,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015WR017485,,,,ERCZO; critical zone; stable isotopes; subsurface hydrology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All humans live in and depend on the CZ. This zone has three co-evolving surfaces: the top of the vegetative canopy, the ground surface, and a deep subsurface below which Earth's materials are unweathered. The network of nine CZ observatories supported by the US National Science Foundation has made advances in three broad areas of CZ research relating to the co-evolving surfaces. First, monitoring has revealed how natural and anthropogenic inputs at the vegetation canopy and ground surface cause subsurface responses in water, regolith structure, minerals, and biotic activity to considerable depths. This response, in turn, impacts aboveground biota and climate. Second, drilling and geophysical imaging now reveal how the deep subsurface of the CZ varies across landscapes, which in turn influences aboveground ecosystems. Third, several new mechanistic models now provide quantitative predictions of the spatial structure of the subsurface of the CZ.<br>Many countries fund critical zone observatories (CZOs) to measure the fluxes of solutes, water, energy, gases, and sediments in the CZ and some relate these observations to the histories of those fluxes recorded in landforms, biota, soils, sediments, and rocks. Each US observatory has succeeded in (i) synthesizing research across disciplines into convergent approaches; (ii) providing long-term measurements to compare across sites; (iii) testing and developing models; (iv) collecting and measuring baseline data for comparison to catastrophic events; (v) stimulating new process-based hypotheses; (vi) catalyzing development of new techniques and instrumentation; (vii) informing the public about the CZ; (viii) mentoring students and teaching about emerging multidisciplinary CZ science; and (ix) discovering new insights about the CZ. Many of these activities can only be accomplished with observatories. Here we review the CZO enterprise in the United States and identify how such observatories could operate in the future as a network designed to generate critical scientific insights. Specifically, we recognize the need for the network to study network-level questions, expand the environments under investigation, accommodate both hypothesis testing and monitoring, and involve more stakeholders.

Individually characterizing streamflow recessions often involves describing the similarities and differences between model parameters fitted to each recession time series. Significant methodological sensitivity has been identified in the fitting and parameterization of models that describe populations of many recessions, but the dependence of estimated model parameters on methodological choices has not been evaluated for event-by-event forms of analysis. Here, we use daily streamflow data from 16 catchments in northern California and southern Oregon to investigate how combinations of commonly used streamflow recession definitions and fitting techniques impact parameter estimates of a widely used power law recession model. Results are relevant to watersheds that are relatively steep, forested, and rain-dominated. The highly seasonal mediterranean climate of northern California and southern Oregon ensures study catchments explore a wide range of recession behaviors and wetness states, ideal for a sensitivity analysis. In such catchments, we show the following: (i) methodological decisions, including ones that have received little attention in the literature, can impact parameter value estimates and model goodness of fit; (ii) the central tendencies of event-scale recession parameter probability distributions are largely robust to methodological choices, in the sense that differing methods rank catchments similarly according to the medians of these distributions; (iii) recession parameter distributions are method-dependent, but roughly catchment-independent, such that changing the choices made about a particular method affects a given parameter in similar ways across most catchments; and (iv) the observed correlative relationship between the power-law recession scale parameter and catchment antecedent wetness varies depending on recession definition and fitting choices. Considering study results, we recommend a combination of four key methodological decisions to maximize the quality of fitted recession curves, and to minimize bias in the related populations of fitted recession parameters.</p>",1/4/2017,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/15/2022 20:08,65-81,,1,21,,,Event-scale power law recession analysis,,,,,,,English,,,,,hess.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,,,ERCZO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples were collected at 1–3 day intervals over 4 years (2009–2013) in Elder Creek in the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory in California. Runoff at our study hillslope is driven by vadose zone flux through deeply weathered argillite (5–25 m thick) to a perched, seasonally dynamic groundwater that then drains to Elder Creek. Low flow derives from the slowly draining deepest perched groundwater that reaches equilibrium between primary and secondary minerals and saturation with calcite under high subsurface pCO2. Arriving winter rains pass through the thick vadose zone, where they rapidly acquire solutes via cation exchange reactions (driven by high pCO2), and then recharge the groundwater that delivers runoff to the stream. These new waters displayed lower solute concentrations than the deep groundwater by less than a factor of 5 (except for Ca). Up to 74% of the total annual solute flux is derived from the vadose zone. The deep groundwater's Ca concentration decreased as it exfiltrates to the stream due to CO2 degassing and this Ca loss is equivalent of 30% of the total chemical weathering flux of Elder Creek. The thick vadose zone in weathered bedrock and the perched groundwater on underlying fresh bedrock result in two distinct processes that lead to the relatively invariant (chemostatic) concentration-discharge behavior.

Though deep CZ processes may seem far removed from the surface, they are vital in shaping it, preparing rock for infusion into the biosphere and breaking Earth materials down for transport across landscapes. This special issue highlights outstanding challenges and recent advances of deep CZ research in a series of articles that we introduce here in the context of relevant literature dating back to the 1500s. Building on several contributions to the special issue, we highlight four exciting new hypotheses about factors that drive deep CZ weathering and thus influence the evolution of life-sustaining CZ architecture. These hypotheses have emerged from recently developed process-based models of subsurface phenomena including: fracturing related to subsurface stress fields; weathering related to drainage of bedrock under hydraulic head gradients; rock damage from frost cracking due to subsurface temperature gradients; and mineral reactions with reactive fluids in subsurface chemical potential gradients. The models predict distinct patterns of subsurface weathering and CZ thickness that can be compared with observations from drilling, sampling and geophysical imaging. We synthesize the four hypotheses into an overarching conceptual model of fracturing and weathering that occurs as Earth materials are exhumed to the surface across subsurface gradients in stress, hydraulic head, temperature, and chemical potential. We conclude with a call for a coordinated measurement campaign designed to comprehensively test the four hypotheses across a range of climatic, tectonic and geologic conditions.

We quantified infection patterns of trout at seven sites within the South Fork Eel River in northern California, visiting each site on three different occasions across the summer, and recording water temperature at each site. We also quantified infection patterns in trout captured from two tributaries to the South Fork Eel River. Overall, trout infection rates were highest in sites with the warmest temperatures. The abundance of ramshorn snails was positively related to both water temperature and black spot infection rates in juvenile trout. Both snail abundance and infection rates increased rapidly above a 23 °C daily maximum, suggesting a threshold effect at this temperature. We suggest that warmer temperatures are associated with environmental and biotic conditions that increase black spot disease prevalence in threatened steelhead trout.

Abundances of freshwater diatom frustules exported to Eel Canyon sediment from 1988 to 2001 were positively correlated with annual biomass of Cladophora surveyed over these years in upper portions of the Eel basin. Over 28 years of contemporary field research, peak algal biomass was generally higher in summers following bankfull, bed-scouring winter floods. Field surveys and experiments suggested that bed-mobilizing floods scour away overwintering grazers, releasing algae from spring and early summer grazing. During wet years, growth conditions for algae could also be enhanced by increased nutrient loading from the watershed, or by sustained summer base flows. Total annual rainfall and frustule densities in laminae over a longer 83-year record were weakly and negatively correlated, however, suggesting that positive effects of floods on annual algal production were primarily mediated by “top-down” (consumer release) rather than “bottom-up” (growth promoting) controls.",9/19/2017,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/22/2022 20:55,10155-10159,,38,114,,PNAS,,,,,,,,en,©  .

Attached algae grow on any submerged surface that receives enough light for photosynthesis, but animals often graze attached algae down to thin, barely perceptible biofilms. Algae in general are more nutritious and digestible than terrestrial plants or detritus, and attached algae are particularly harvestable, being concentrated on surfaces. Diatoms, a major component of attached algal assemblages, are especially nutritious and tolerant of heavy grazing. Algivores can track attached algal productivity over a range of spatial scales and consume a high proportion of new attached algal growth in high-light, low-nutrient ecosystems. The subsequent efficient conversion of the algae into consumer production in freshwater food webs can lead to low-producer, high-consumer biomass, patterns that Elton (1927) described as inverted trophic pyramids.

The decline in the shade-intolerant Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana var. garryana) is attributed to increased competition with the tall-growing Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) as a result of widespread fire exclusion. In a warmer, drier future, both species will experience increased water stress, and their distribution will depend on ecophysiological adaptations to water limitation, of which little is known for Q. garryana. Here, we report a suite of new ecophysiological observations to better understand the oak's water-limitation tolerance, in order to predict its fate in a changing climate. Our study site in the Central Belt of the Franciscan Formation in the Northern California Coast Ranges receives almost no rain in the leaf-on growing season and has limited subsurface water storage capacity. In spite of low pre-dawn water potentials (Ψ; to below −3.0 MPa), mature trees maintained high rates of sapflow. Sapflow continued due to a high Ψ gradient (≈1.6 MPa on average) at mid-day between shoots and the subsurface (inferred from pre-dawn measurements) throughout the dry season. Depletion and recharge of stored water in stem tissue and leaves helped to sustain transpiration. Leaves experienced low Ψ (below −4 MPa), and declining hydraulic conductance yet remained functional. Pressure–volume curve analyses revealed that the maintenance of positive turgor pressures in leaves at low Ψ may be attributable to dynamic adjustment due to changes in cell wall elasticity. The turgor loss point may be of limited use in delineating ecophysiological limits to growth and reproduction, as transpiration and apparently normal physiological behavior continued after pre-dawn water potentials declined below turgor loss limits inferred from rehydrated leaves. These findings indicate that Q. garryana is a water-limitation-tolerant tree species that maintains hydraulic function as subsurface water supply and atmospheric demand conditions exceed the ranges at which P. menziesii can operate. These observations can be used to explain Q. garryana's extant species range and anticipate its likely resilience in a warmer climate.",2018,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/15/2022 19:51,e02218,,5,9,,,Controls on the distribution and resilience of Quercus garryana,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.2218,,,,ERCZO; Garry Oak; Mediterranean climate; Oregon White Oak; Quercus garryana; drought; ecophysiology; fire exclusion; plant–water relations; sapflow; water potential; water storage; water-limitation tolerance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QHK56SKQ,thesis,2018,"Kelson, Suzanne","Evolutionary Ecology of Partial Migration: A Case Study from a Pacific Salmonid Fish, Oncorhynchus mykiss",,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/63b9r39q,"Intraspecific diversity, or trait differences among individuals of the same species, is important for ecological interactions. Through my dissertation research, I explore the linkages between genotypes, phenotypes, and ecology in nature. I highlight partially migratory populations as systems that are ripe for understanding these linkages. Partially migratory populations are ones that are comprised of migratory and resident individuals – a strong form of intraspecific variation. There is growing appreciation that many migratory populations are in fact comprised of both migratory and resident individuals, including culturally and economically valuable populations of ungulates and salmonid fishes. I focused on a salmonid fish native to the Pacific Rim, Oncorhynchus mykiss. In this system, both migratory and resident forms breed and rear in freshwater. The migratory form (“steelhead trout”) then out-migrates to the ocean to feed and grow, returning to freshwater to breed. In contrast, the resident form (“rainbow trout”) completes its entire life cycle in freshwater. Recent research by Pearse et al. (2014, Proc. Roy. Soc. B) revealed that the genetic basis of migration in O. mykiss is linked to a narrow region of the genome, which opened the door to understanding genotype-phenotype-ecology linkages. My dissertation explores these connections in partially migratory populations of O. mykiss in two streams, Fox and Elder Creek, which are tributaries to the South Fork Eel River in coastal Northern California. In my first chapter, I explored the spatial distribution of migration-linked genetic variation in these streams. I predicted that small natural barriers would limit the upstream distribution of migratory genotypes, and that the effect of these barriers would be greater in dry years when there is less opportunity for adult steelhead passage. In Elder Creek, the largest barrier is a waterfall located 2 km from the mouth of the stream, and is passable under a narrow range of stream flows. In Fox Creek, the largest barrier is at the mouth. I captured fish from pools distributed longitudinally from the mouth to the upper extent of fish in each stream. I conducted RAD-capture on over 3,000 individuals and then classified these individuals as migratory, heterozygous, or resident genotypes using over 400 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on the migration-linked region of the genome. The partial barrier in Elder Creek reduced the frequency of migratory genotypes (migratory allele frequency of 0.60 below the barrier vs. 0.31 above the barrier). In Fox Creek, the proportion of migratory alleles varied greatly among years, ranging from 0.30-0.68. Years when migratory allele frequency was low were also years when there was not a storm event in February, which is peak breeding season for O. mykiss in the South Fork Eel River, suggesting that the frequency of migratory genotypes is tied to adult steelhead access in this creek. Overall, I found that there was spatial variation in migration-linked genotypes, with migratory genotype-fish being more common below the waterfall in Elder Creek, and rare in some years in Fox Creek. Furthermore, inter-annual variation was associated with water year type (dry or wet) and the timing of rainfall events. In my second chapter, I determined the correlation between life history genotypes and phenotypes at the individual level. I installed stationary antennas at the mouth of Fox and Elder creeks to detect individuals who expressed migration, and assigned individuals to the resident phenotype using a size threshold. I found that resident-phenotype fish were dominated by resident genotypes (55% resident, 39% heterozygous, and 6% migratory genotypes), but migratory-phenotype fish were comprised of a mix of genotypes (25% resident, 45% heterozygous, and 30% migratory genotypes). Females are more likely to express migration in salmonid systems, given that larger females are more fecund. Therefore, I predicted that including information on sex would improve our ability to explain phenotypic variation. Genetic sex typing confirmed that females were more likely to express migration: migratory-phenotype fish were 62% female while resident-phenotype fish were 79% male. This is the first study to use life history genotypes and sex to predict individual phenotypes in partially migratory O. mykiss. In my third chapter, I explored the connections between genotype and aspects of ecology, including population ecology (density and size structure of O. mykiss) and community ecology (food chain length and trophic cascades). During fish sampling, I estimated the density and size structure of fish in study pools. I found that stream reaches dominated by migratory genotypes were characterized by double the density of juvenile fish as compared to resident-dominated reaches (0.46 vs 0.26 individuals/m2), presumably reflecting the higher fecundity of migratory females, but half as many older fish (0.05 vs. 0.13 individuals/m2). Furthermore, differences in size structure were linked to differences in trophic structure; stable isotope analyses revealed that larger, old fish, were feeding higher on the food web (6.1± 0.62 ‰ δ15N vs for age-0 fish and 7.8 ± 0.83 ‰ δ15N for older fish). Overall, pools within the migratory-dominated region were characterized by many young fish (simple size structure) and a shorter food chain than pools sampled in regions dominated by resident genotypes.Finally, I explored how inter-annual variation in precipitation influenced two key aspects of O. mykiss ecology: downstream migration timing and over-summer growth. My research occurred during the multi-year drought in California and included two dry years (2014 and 2015) and two wet years (2016 and 2017). Despite large differences in overall rainfall magnitudes, out-migration timing and over-summer growth differed little among years, which highlights the value of shaded, groundwater fed streams with a water-storing lithology for the conservation of salmonid fishes in warming river systems. Overall, my dissertation provides empirical support for linkages among genotypes, phenotypes, and ecology, while also highlighting partially migratory O. mykiss populations as a model system for investigating the ecological consequences of intraspecific variation. Partially migratory populations may be common systems where heritable intraspecific variation is associated with ecological change.

The extent of wetted channels and magnitude of base flow throughout the network, however, are rarely documented, and no general theory currently exists enabling the prediction of these key ecosystem properties. We conducted channel surveys in early and late summers of 2012, 2014, and 2015 in four headwater drainage networks (2.8–17.0 km2, in the Franciscan Formation of the Eel River (Northern California)), two of which are underlain by the Coastal Belt (argillite and inter-bedded sandstone) and two of which are underlain by the Central Belt (sheared argillaceous-matrix, meta-sedimentary mélange). In all networks, stationary springs controlled the extent of flow. Though surveyed during a period of multiyear drought, the two adjacent Coastal Belt networks remained flowing throughout late-summer months, sustained by drainage from groundwater stored in thick weathered bedrock above fresh, impermeable bedrock. Flow magnitudes, however, decreased and surface flows became increasingly discontinuous, largely due to infiltration into thick gravel deposits on the channel bed. Only 23 km away, in the Central Belt mélange, channel flow ceased early in the summer because the thin critical zone (typically <3 m) stored little water. All late-summer flowing water initiated from deep-rooted sandstone blocks and terminated a short distance downslope. Our findings suggest that lithology and critical zone development exert primary controls on wetted channel extent. Given similar annual precipitation, nearby watersheds can have dramatically different summer wetted channel networks that result in fundamentally different aquatic ecosystems.",2018,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/15/2022 19:51,5702-5726,,8,54,,,Drainage from the Critical Zone,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2017WR021903,,,,ERCZO; base flow; channel head; channel network; critical zone; drainage networks; wetted channels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weathering turns otherwise poorly conductive bedrock into a dynamic water storage reservoir. Infiltrating precipitation typically will pass through unsaturated weathered bedrock before reaching groundwater and running off to streams. This invisible and difficult to access unsaturated zone is virtually unexplored compared with the surface soil mantle. We have proposed the term “rock moisture” to describe the exchangeable water stored in the unsaturated zone in weathered bedrock, purposely choosing a term parallel to, but distinct from, soil moisture, because weathered bedrock is a distinctly different material that is distributed across landscapes independently of soil thickness. Here, we report a multiyear intensive campaign of quantifying rock moisture across a hillslope underlain by a thick weathered bedrock zone using repeat neutron probe measurements in a suite of boreholes. Rock moisture storage accumulates in the wet season, reaches a characteristic upper value, and rapidly passes any additional rainfall downward to groundwater. Hence, rock moisture storage mediates the initiation and magnitude of recharge and runoff. In the dry season, rock moisture storage is gradually depleted by trees for transpiration, leading to a common lower value at the end of the dry season. Up to 27% of the annual rainfall is seasonally stored as rock moisture. Significant rock moisture storage is likely common, and yet it is missing from hydrologic and land-surface models used to predict regional and global climate.",3/13/2018,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/15/2022 19:53,2664-2669,,11,115,,PNAS,,,,,,,,en,© 2018 . http://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.,,,,www.pnas.org,,Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Physical Sciences PMID: 29490920,,,,Critical Zone; ERCZO; deep vadose zone; evapotranspiration; rock moisture; water budget,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biogeochemical models rely almost exclusively on clay content to modify rates of SOM turnover and fluxes of climate-active CO2 to the atmosphere. Emerging conceptual understanding, however, suggests other soil physicochemical properties may predict SOM stabilization better than clay content. We addressed this discrepancy by synthesizing data from over 5,500 soil profiles spanning continental scale environmental gradients. Here, we demonstrate that other physicochemical parameters are much stronger predictors of SOM content, with clay content having relatively little explanatory power.

These knickpoints and the surrounding “stepped topography” suggest that the landscape is still responding to Pleistocene changes in base level on main-stem rivers. We tested this hypothesis using cosmogenic nuclides and uranium isotopes measured in stream sediment from widely distributed locations. Catchment-scale erosion rates from the cosmogenic nuclides suggest that the treads are relict surfaces that have adjusted to a previous base level. Nevertheless, erosion rates of relict interfluves are similar to canyon incision rates, implying that relief is unchanging in the lower Kings and San Joaquin Rivers. In addition, our results suggest that much of the southern Sierra Nevada is in a state of arrested development: the landscape is not fully adjusted to—and moreover is not responding to— changes in base-level lowering in the canyons. We propose that this can be explained by a paucity of coarse sediment supply, which fails to provide sufficient tools for bedrock channel incision at knickpoints. We hypothesize that the lack of coarse sediment in channels is driven by intense weathering of the local granitic bedrock, which reduces the size of sediment supplied from hillslopes to the channels. Our analysis highlights a feedback in which sediment size reduction due to weathering on hillslopes and transport in channels is both a key response to and control of bedrock channel incision and landscape adjustment to base-level change.",2/14/2019,2/7/2024 6:45,2024-02-07T06:45:38Z,2/15/2022 19:42,1179-1202,,8-Jul,131,,GSA Bulletin,Arrested development,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In freshwater environments, cold water fish species such as Pacific salmonids already rely on thermal microrefugia to persist in the southern extent of their range. Identifying sites that can provide such thermal microrefugia is essential to inform conservation and management decisions. At present, however, there is no consensus on appropriate ways to identify such sites, and multiple approaches are presented in the literature. Here, we use high resolution thermal data from two cold-water zones created at the confluence of tributaries with a warm main channel of the South Fork Eel River in Northern California to demonstrate that the characteristics of cold zones identified as thermal microrefugia are not robust to the choice of microrefugium definition. Common definitions disagree on the existence, volume, seasonal temporal trends, and diurnal variations in microrefugia at the two confluences. The disagreements arise from the complex interaction between the confluence mixing regime with diurnal/seasonal warming patterns and how this shapes the distribution of water temperature at the confluences, and how it is classified by each definition. The disagreements cannot be resolved by simple bias correction approaches.

KFAFMGKT,thesis,2019,"Hahm, William Jesse",Critical Zone Ecohydrology of the Northern California Coast Ranges,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9g8492jx,"Earth's critical zone includes plants as well as the heterogeneous near-surface layers into which they are rooted: the soil, saprolite, and weathered bedrock. It is within the critical zone (CZ) that water is stored and then released to streams and withdrawn by vegetation, highlighting its importance to humans, ecosystems, and the functioning of the Earth system in general. The research presented here is motivated by the global-scale challenges of mapping and predicting subsurface critical zone structure and understanding how that structure impacts water routing and storage for terrestrial ecosystems. It addresses these challenges by shedding light on inter-related ecohydrologic puzzles presented at the regional-scale across natural landscapes in the Eel River watershed: What explains the persistence and dominance of a particular species of oak, Quercus garryana, across savannas typified in the dry season by rolling golden hills mantled by senesced annual grasses? What explains the sharp ecotone that extends for hundreds of kilometers between this oak savanna community and a dense evergreen forest in a region of similar climate? Why did plant communities in this region fare better than others in the face of recent extreme drought?By studying Quercus garryana's ecophysiology, I show that the oak is extremely water-limitation tolerant, which explains its ability to persist where a thin subsurface critical zone provides limited water storage capacity. Through sapflow monitoring on mature trees inhabiting an upslope position in the Central belt melange of the Franciscan, I reveal that the oaks maintain high rates of transpiration throughout the summer dry season, even as pre-dawn water potentials dropped to very low levels (below -3 MPa). At this site, Douglas fir has not encroached upon the oak groves like it has elsewhere throughout their mutual range. This is presumably due to Douglas fir's lower water limitation tolerance, and anticipates Quercus garryana's likely persistence in a warmer, drier future along western North America.Through geospatial analysis coupled with intensive hillslope- and catchment-scale hydrological observation, I show that under a similar climate, adjacent landscapes across an extensive region of the Northern California Coast Ranges are either evergreen forest or deciduous oak savannah depending on their subsurface lithology. This is due to lithologically controlled contrasts in the extent of bedrock weathering and water storage capacity and thereby plant‐-available moisture in the summer dry season: a thick subsurface critical zone stores ample moisture and supports evergreen forest, whereas an adjacent thin subsurface critical zone sheds wet season rains and sustains savannah. The thick subsurface critical zone occurs in the modestly deformed shales and sandstones of the Coastal belt of the Franciscan; the thin subsurface critical zone occurs in the intensely deformed mud-matrix melange of the Central belt of the Franciscan. An important difference between the rock types is the thickness of the weathered bedrock layer; in contrast, the soil layer is of similar thickness. The thicker weathered bedrock at the Coastal belt site results in a larger rock moisture reservoir, i.e., unsaturated water residing within the weathered bedrock, which is primarily responsible for sustaining summer transpiration after shallow soils have dried. Extensive drilling was used to characterize the subsurface weathering extent and water storage dynamics, and was complemented by point--scale precipitation monitoring, catchment-wide remotely sensed evapotranspiration, and stream gauging to determine annual water budgets. Finally, late--summer dry season pre-dawn water potential observations in the dominant trees at both sites were used to compare subsurface water availability and show that where the weathered bedrock was thicker and hosted more rock moisture, the forest was less water stressed.The observation of plant-available water in the dry season being mediated by the water storage capacity of the critical zone motivated a new hypothesis for how the subsurface can regulate plant response to drought: where annual rainfall reliably exceeds subsurface storage capacity, plant productivity and water use in summer should be insensitive to winter rainfall variability, because the subsurface water storage is replenished in wet and dry years alike. A simple ecohydrologic model for water storage in seasonally dry, Mediterranean climates predicts that storage will be replenished most reliably where the average precipitation is high relative to the subsurface storage capacity and winter evapotranspiration, and where year-to-year variability in precipitation is low. In order to test whether this storage-capacity limited behavior indeed decouples plants from inter-annual rainfall variability, running winter water balances were calculated for all unimpaired and generally undisturbed rain-dominated Mediterranean USGS catchments, using runoff, gridded precipitation and remotely sensed evapotranspiration as input data. These water balances revealed that sites in the Northern California Coast Ranges exhibited storage-capacity limitation, unlike most of the rest of the state. At all of the sites in the Northern California Coast Ranges, the consistent summer plant water supply resulted in plant insensitivity to rainfall variability, as revealed by remotely sensed summer plant greenness. Such sites are inherently resilient to meteorological drought, helping to explain the lack of mortality in the region in the extreme 2011-2016 drought.",2019,2/7/2024 6:45,2024-02-07T06:45:38Z,2/18/2022 19:43,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Berkeley,,en,,,,,escholarship.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shifts in precipitation patterns will alter stream flow regimes, affecting critical life history stages of sensitive aquatic organisms. Understanding how threatened fish species, such as steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), are affected by stream flows in years with contrasting environmental conditions is important for their conservation. Here, we report how extreme wet and dry years, from 2015 to 2018, affected stream flow patterns in two tributaries to the South Fork Eel River, California, USA, and aspects of O. mykiss ecology, including over-summer fish growth and body condition as well as spring out-migration timing. We found that stream flow patterns differed across years in the timing and magnitude of large winter–spring flow events and in summer low-flow levels. We were surprised to find that differences in stream flows did not impact growth, body condition, or timing of out-migration of O. mykiss. Fish growth was limited in the late summer in these streams (average of 0.02 ± 0.05 mm/d), but was similar across dry and wet years, and so was end-of-summer body condition and pool-specific biomass loss from the beginning to the end of the summer. Similarly, O. mykiss migrated out of tributaries during the last week of March/first week of April regardless of the timing of spring flow events. We suggest that the muted response to inter-annual hydrologic variability is due to the high quality of habitat provided by these unimpaired, groundwater-fed tributaries. Similar streams that are likely to maintain cool temperatures and sufficient base flows, even in the driest years, should be a high priority for conservation and restoration efforts.",2019,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 19:43,e02618,,3,10,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.2618,,,,ERCZO; Oncorhynchus mykiss; drought; growth; headwaters; migration; salmonids; stream flows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated this question by examining the chemical weathering and porosity profiles from catchments developed on marine shale located in Pennsylvania, USA (Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, SSHCZO); California, USA (Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, ERCZO); and Taiwan (Fushan Experimental Forest). The protolith compositions, protolith porosities, and the depths of regolith at these sites are roughly similar while the catchments are characterized by large differences in erosion rate (1–3 mm yr−1 in Fushan ≫ 0.2–0.4 mm yr−1 in ERCZO ≫ 0.01–0.025 mm yr−1 in SSHCZO). The natural experiment did not totally isolate erosion as a variable: mean annual precipitation varied along the erosion gradient (4.2 m yr−1 in Fushan > 1.9 m yr−1 in ERCZO > 1.1 m yr−1 in SSHCZO), so the fastest eroding site experiences nearly twice the mean annual temperature of the other two. Even though erosion rates varied by about 100×, the depth of pyrite and carbonate depletion (defined here as regolith thickness) is roughly the same, consistent with chemical weathering of those minerals keeping up with erosion at the three sites. These minerals were always observed to be the deepest to react, and they reacted until 100% depletion. In two of three of the catchments where borehole observations were available for ridges, these minerals weathered across narrow reaction fronts. On the other hand, for the rock-forming clay mineral chlorite, the depth interval of weathering was wide and the extent of depletion observed at the land surface decreased with increasing erosion/precipitation. Thus, chemical weathering of the clay did not keep pace with erosion rate. But perhaps the biggest difference among the shales is that in the fast-eroding sites, microfractures account for 30–60% of the total porosity while in the slow-eroding shale, dissolution could be directly related to secondary porosity. We argue that the microfractures increase the influx of oxygen at depth and decrease the size of diffusion-limited internal domains of matrix, accelerating weathering of pyrite and carbonate under high erosion-rate conditions. Thus, microfracturing is a process that can couple physical erosion and chemical weathering in shales.",1/15/2020,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 19:40,63-100,,,269,,Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,"Chemical reactions, porosity, and microfracturing in shale during weathering",,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Chemical weathering; Erosion; Microfracture; Porosity; Shale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCD87DF3,thesis,2020,"Rossi, Gabriel J.","Food, Phenology, and Flow—How Prey Phenology and Streamflow Dynamics Affect the Behavior, Ecology, and Recovery of Pacific Salmon",,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7640c4sw,"Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus) are an iconic genus of anadromous fish whose decline over the last century has linked indigenous peoples, government agencies, fishers, advocates, and scientists in the common, albeit messy, cause of salmon recovery. While the history of ecology, and the earliest research on Pacific salmon, is grounded in the understanding that food web and prey dynamics control the abundance and distribution of predators, the last half-century of salmon management has focused primarily on hatchery production and physical habitat suitability. The continued decline of Pacific salmon, after decades of efforts to restore them, has prompted salmon ecologists to remember what Charles Elton (1927) understood nearly a century ago: “Food is the burning question in animal society, and the whole structure and activities of the community are dependent upon questions of food-supply.” My dissertation proceeds from the observation that both salmon management and salmon ecology have placed too little emphasis on aquatic food webs, animal behavior, and biotic interactions as key drivers of salmon production and resilience—and thus as chief mechanisms of salmon recovery. This dissertation is comprised of a series of studies and experiments from 2016 to 2019, which explore how the seasonal interaction among physical habitat, phenology of salmon prey, and foraging behavior affects juvenile salmon growth and performance. The experiments described here take place near the southern end of the range of Pacific salmon—in Mediterranean streams along the Pacific Coast of California. These streams experience a characteristic recession of streamflow between spring and fall, which is an ideal natural gradient to investigate the dynamic interaction between physical habitat and prey phenology. The studies described here also focus on one species of Pacific salmon—Oncorhynchus mykiss (the “steelhead” or “rainbow trout”). My first chapter starts from the observation that O. mykiss are typically considered drift foragers that occupy higher velocity habitat than other salmonids. Yet their persistence in Mediterranean coastal streams with seasonally low velocity and drift suggests an underappreciated flexibility in foraging behavior. Using novel 3-D videogrammetry along with measurements of invertebrate drift and stream hydraulics, I quantified the seasonality of foraging behaviors that O. mykiss employ during the spring-summer flow recession. I also explored the factors that trigger of foraging mode shifts, which are important for both ecological interactions and salmon management. I found that 80% of O. mykiss were drift foraging in May, 2018; while over 70% used alternative foraging modes by July. Foraging mode was significantly correlated to maximum water velocity and to riffle crest depth. While drift concentration was a poor univariate predictor, the top-ranked statistical models of foraging mode included both hydraulic variables and drift concentration. This study revealed that O. mykiss in Mediterranean streams express more diverse foraging behavior than previously suggested in the literature, and that changes in foraging mode could be predicted by simple hydraulic indicators. This study also lead us to speculate that non-drifting prey fluxes, as well as risk aversion, may influence late-summer foraging decisions in Mediterranean coastal streams.In my second chapter I took advantage of an existing streamflow augmentation project to conduct a novel manipulative experiment to elevate dry-season flow in an intermittent, salmon-bearing stream. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study design, I directly measured the responses of O. mykiss behavior, their invertebrate prey, physical habitat, and water quality to flow enhancement. I found that elevating mid-summer baseflow for one week caused significant increases in dissolved oxygen, riffle width, depth, velocity, invertebrate drift, and benthic invertebrate standing crop – and these changes were evident at sites more than 1 km downstream from the point of flow augmentation. I also documented consistent behavioral changes indicating that pool-dwelling salmonids were able to exploit the increased prey abundance and improved metabolic environment in the treatment reach after flow augmentation. Counts of foraging salmonids near riffle-pool transition zones doubled, foraging movement remained steady (relative to decreasing movement in the control reach), and the proportion of drift foraging salmonids increased from an average of 26% to an average of 77% after augmentation. Collectively, these results suggest that dry season flow enhancement can significantly improve habitat profitability for salmonids, but that the timing and location of flow augmentation, relative to downstream points of interest, are critical to meeting ecological objectives.In my third chapter I propose a conceptual model for how stream hydraulics and secondary production interact to affect foraging profitability for juvenile salmon during the streamflow recession in Mediterranean coastal streams. I evaluated the model by comparing two distinct salmonid rearing streams—one perennial, cool, and shaded; the other intermittent, seasonally warm, and sunny. In both streams, I conducted a photon-to-salmon food web study to document the seasonality of hydraulic habitat relative to the phenology of prey biomass for O. mykiss. I also estimated the seasonal change in O. mykiss growth potential using a drift foraging bioenergetics model. Both streams offered profitable foraging opportunities for O. mykiss, but modeled growth potential peaked at least two months earlier in the intermittent stream, where lipid storage measured in mid-July was nearly twice as high. In contrast, modeled and measured early-summer growth was higher in the perennial stream. By late summer, foraging profitability declined in both streams. However, abiotic conditions approached lethal tolerance levels in the intermittent stream, whereas the perennial stream maintained suitable abiotic conditions all summer. Seasonal changes in growth potential were explained by the timing of streamflow recession relative to the phenology of prey fluxes. But ecological interactions (especially intraspecific competition) and flexible foraging behavior both appear to have mediated realized foraging opportunity. These observations lead me to speculate that juvenile O. mykiss life histories should differ among streams, due to the timing of their spring-summer growth potential and to differing late summer survival rates. Collectively, these stream types could contribute to a stabilizing portfolio of juvenile salmonid life histories.",2020,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/18/2022 19:45,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Berkeley,,en,,,,,escholarship.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because soils are both a host and a product of rhizosphere activity, they are thought to mark the location where photosynthetic fixation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is balanced by the oxidation of organic matter. However, in many terrestrial environments, the rhizosphere extends below soils and into fractured bedrock, and it is unknown if the resulting biological and hydrologic dynamics in bedrock have a significant impact on carbon cycling. Here we show substantial production of CO2 in weathered bedrock at 4–8 m below the thin soils (<0.5 m thick) of a Northern California forest using innovative monitoring technology for sampling gases and water in fractured rock. The deep CO2 production supports a persistent upward flux of CO2(g) year-round from bedrock to soil, constituting between 2% and 29% of the average daily CO2 efflux from the land surface. When water is rapidly transported across the fractured bedrock vadose zone, nearly 50% of the CO2 produced in the bedrock dissolves into water, promoting water-rock interaction and export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the unsaturated zone to groundwater, constituting as much as 80% of the DIC exiting the hillslope. Such CO2 production in weathered bedrock is subject to unique moisture, temperature, biological, and mineralogical conditions which are currently missing from terrestrial carbon models.",2020,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 19:38,e2020JG005795,,12,125,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020JG005795,,,,ERCZO,carbon dioxide; critical zone; vadose zone; weathering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By measuring the flux of aquatic insect emergence from six habitats in a river over summer, we found that the timing of emergence varied by habitats for each dominant taxa, and that different species emerged at different times of the summer sequentially. We found that spatial variation in the emergence timing caused by the spatial heterogeneity of the water temperature, and so on in the source habitat can temporally stabilize the subsidy of each species from the whole river. Similarly, we found that the variation in emergence timing between species contributed to the temporal stability of subsidies from each habitat. The contribution of spatial heterogeneity to the temporal stability varied by the focal species and the contribution of species diversity varied by habitats.

A common perception is that river systems dampen rainfall variability by averaging spatial and temporal variations in their watersheds. However, by analyzing 671 watersheds throughout the United States, we find that many catchments actually amplify the coefficient of variation of rainfall, and that these catchments also likely amplify changes in rainfall variability. Based on catchment-scale water balance principles, we relate that faculty to the interplay between two fundamental hydrological processes: water uptake by vegetation and the storage and subsequent release of water as discharge. By increasing plant water uptake, warmer temperatures might exacerbate the amplifying effect of catchments. More variable precipitations associated with a warmer climate are therefore expected to lead to even more variable river flows—a significant potential challenge for river transportation, ecosystem sustainability and water supply reliability.",2021-07,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 1:45,084032,,8,16,,Environ.

Studying these interactions, however, can be difficult because many insects, especially parasites, impinge most strongly on plants during larval stages when they are morphologically difficult to identify, and many belong to diverse groups for which most species remain undescribed. We used DNA barcoding to identify nondescript lepidopteran larvae that regularly parasitize flower buds of the coastal dune endemic Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia (Onagraceae). We obtained cytochrome oxidase 1 mitochondrial DNA sequences from 201 parasite specimens from across the host geographical range. The Barcode of Life Database Identification System combined with Bayesian analysis grouped all 15 parasite haplotypes in a distinct, monophyletic clade within the genus Mompha (Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae: Momphinae), a group known to be host specialists on plants of the Onagraceae. Species identity and phylogenetic affinities within Mompha could not be confirmed because few barcode sequences exist from this diverse and poorly known group of moths. However, morphological analysis, including detailed dissection of genitalia for a subsample of 23 reared adults and comparison with known species of Mompha, also indicated that the larvae parasitizing C. cheiranthifolia constitute a distinct and undescribed species within this genus. Knowing that floral parasitism of C. cheiranthifolia involves a single, putatively host-specific microlepidopteran greatly facilitates formulating and testing hypotheses concerning how floral parasitism has promoted the evolution of striking floral diversity within this species. More generally, DNA barcoding combined with morphological analysis can greatly hasten identification of problematic specimens and enhance our understanding of the diversity, ecology and evolution of plant–insect interactions.",5/1/2009,2/4/2020 19:38,2020-02-04T19:38:50Z,12/3/2016 3:25,217-223,,,9,,,Combining DNA barcoding and morphological analysis to identify specialist floral parasites (Lepidoptera,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia; DNA barcoding; florivory; genitalia; microlepidoptera; mtDNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable isotope studies in small, forested streams in northern California have shown that G. penitum larvae derive most of their carbon from algae, despite low algal standing crops. We hypothesized that the caddisfly competes with other primary consumers (including mayflies) for algal food and increases their reliance on terrestrial detritus. Because Glossosoma are abundant and defended from predators by stone cases, their consumption of algal energy may reduce its transfer up the food chain. We removed Glossosoma (natural densities >1000 caddisflies/m2) from five (4 m2) stream sections during the summer of 2000 and measured responses of algae, invertebrate primary consumers, and invertebrate predators. The treatment reduced Glossosoma biomass by 80–90%. We observed a doubling in chlorophyll a per area in sections with reduced Glossosoma abundance and aggregative increases in the biomass of undefended primary consumers. Heptageniid mayfly larvae consumed more algae (as measured by stable carbon isotope ratios and gut content analysis) in caddisfly removal plots at the end of the 60-day experiment, although not after one month. We did not see isotopic evidence of increased algal carbon in invertebrate predators, however. Patterns of caddisfly and mayfly diets in the surrounding watershed suggested that mayfly diets are variable and include algae and detrital carbon in variable proportions, but scraping caddisflies consume primarily algae. Caddisfly and mayfly diets are more similar in larger, more productive streams where the mayflies assimilate more algae. Isotopic analysis, in combination with measurements of macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass in unmanipulated plots, suggested that a substantial portion of the invertebrate community (>50% of biomass) was supported, at least partially, by local algal carbon during midsummer. These data suggest that algae may be more important to community dynamics in headwater streams than their relatively low productivity would suggest. Through their high densities and relative invulnerability to predation, armored grazers may also affect community structure and flow of algal and detrital carbon in headwater streams.",2/1/2007,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:40Z,3/31/2014 5:51,391-401,,2,88,,Ecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,ESA Journals,,,,,,Diet; Food web; Glossosoma; algae; armored grazer; caddisfly; competition; detritus; energy flow; headwater stream; mayfly; stable carbon isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

California roach and juvenile steelhead consume predatory insects and fish fry, which feed on algivorous chironomid larvae. In the presence of fish, filamentous green algae are reduced to low, prostrate webs, infested with chironomids. When the absence of large fish releases smaller predators that suppress chironomids, algal biomass is higher, and tall upright algal turfs become covered with diatoms and cyanobacteria. These manipulations provide evidence that the Hairston, Smith, Slobodkin-Fretwell theory of trophic control, which predicts that plants will be alternately limited by resources or herbivores in food webs with odd and even numbers of trophic levels, has application to river communitics.",11/9/1990,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:35Z,1/19/2013 8:04,811-814,,4982,250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CrossRef,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this challenge, a new science agenda is needed that integrates people with the rest of nature to help chart a more sustainable trajectory for the relationship between society and the biosphere. This paper describes Earth Stewardship, an initiative of the Ecological Society of America to provide the scientific basis for actively shaping trajectories of social-ecological change to enhance ecosystem resilience and human well-being. Principles for moving toward these goals include simultaneous attention to multiple scales and issues; consideration of both ecological and socioeconomic consequences; alignment of incentives with stewardship behavior; strengthening peoples' connections to valued places; and using demographic transitions as new opportunities for stewardship. Past experience provides guidelines for fostering Earth Stewardship. Early attention to sustainable pathways before problems emerge generally provides more cost-effective solutions than attempting to remediate entrenched problems. Defining sustainable pathways by assessing tradeoffs among alternative options requires careful attention to fine-scale processes, interactions, and feedbacks and to larger-scale controls and constraints. Many opportunities occur locally, through development of practices that match the properties of resources with the needs of their users. Substantial challenges remain at larger scales, including maintaining the diversity, productive capacity, and resilience of nature, which are essential for long-term human welfare. The knowledge needed to inform stewardship requires an interdisciplinary science that draws on the observations, skills, and creativity of a wide range of natural and social scientists, practitioners, and civil society. New questions and solutions will emerge when these groups work together to formulate the issues, design the research, and co-produce the observations, knowledge, and concepts that form the basis for solutions. The goal of Earth Stewardship is not to protect nature from people; rather it is to protect nature for human welfare.",8/1/2011,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:31Z,3/31/2014 5:11,art89,,8,2,,Ecosphere,Earth Stewardship,,,,,,,,,,,,ESA Journals,,,,,,Earth Stewardship; Ecological Society of America; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem services; governance; human well-being; sustainability; worldview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The paper defines the components of Earth Stewardship, characterizes the scientific needs for its agenda, and discusses initial efforts to engage multiple disciplines and segments of society in its application. As a beginning, new knowledge for global stewardship must be generated by teams of physical, biological, and social scientists. However, other stakeholders are needed for generating and applying such knowledge, including people in communities of faith, professions involved in design, planning and restoration, and policymakers and managers.

Western fence lizards, Sceloporus occidentalis, limit their activity and feeding in meadows to a variety of structures (e.g., stumps, logs, brush, and rock piles). The impact of lizards on their primary prey, grasshoppers, decreased at a decreasing rate with distance from structures that housed lizards; thus, grasshopper densities increased with distance. Consequently, the abundance of plants (grasshoppers’ food) decreased with distance from these structures. However, the relative abundance of plants varied with distance. The proportion of herbaceous forbs (the grasshoppers’ preferred resource) was greatest near lizard structures, whereas the proportion of less edible grasses was greater far from lizard structures. There were no such relationships between grasshoppers or plants and distance from similar structures that did not house lizards. Near the structure, an exclosure experiment showed a very strong impact of lizards on grasshopper populations. Plant biomass and the relative proportion of forbs were higher with lizards present than in lizard exclosures, suggesting a trophic cascade. An identical exclosure experiment far (15 m) from the structure, where lizard activity was greatly reduced, showed no such cascades. Thus, this study showed evidence for strong consumer effects in a grassland system. However, small-scale differences in foraging behaviors (possibly due to predation risk) may importantly affect the outcomes of these interactions.",6/1/1998,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:25Z,3/31/2014 5:21,1236-1245,,4,79,,Ecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,ESA Journals,,,,,,Grasshoppers; Sceloporus occidentalis; Western fence lizard; central place; food chains; foraging; meadows; trophic cascades,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Native yellow-legged frogs, Rana boylii, a species of special concern, were almost an order of magnitude less abundant in reaches where bullfrogs were well established. I assessed the potential role of larval competition in contributing to this displacement in a series of field manipulations of tadpole density and species composition. The impact of R. catesbeiana on native tadpoles in the natural community agreed with the outcome of more artificial experiments testing pairwise and three-way interactions. In 2-m2 enclosures with ambient densities of tadpoles and natural river biota, bullfrog tadpoles caused a 48% reduction in survivorship of R. boylii, and a 24% decline in mass at metamorphosis. Bullfrog larvae had smaller impacts on Pacific treefrogs, Hyla regilla, causing 16% reduction in metamorph size, and no significant effect on survivorship. Bullfrog tadpoles significantly affected benthic algae, although effects varied across sites. Responses to bullfrogs in field settings were similar qualitatively to results seen in smaller-scale experiments designed to study size-structured competition among disparate age/size classes of species pairs and trios. Competition from large overwintering bullfrog larvae significantly decreased survivorship and growth of native tadpoles. Competition from recently hatched bullfrog larvae also decreased survivorship of R. boylii and H. regilla. Native species competed weakly, both interspecifically and intraspecifically. The only suggestion of a negative impact of a native species on bullfrogs was a weak effect of H. regilla on recent hatchlings. Competition appeared to be mediated by algal resources, and there was no evidence for behavioral or chemical interference. These results indicate that, through larval interactions, bullfrogs can exert differential effects on native frogs and perturb aquatic community structure.",9/1/1997,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:24Z,3/31/2014 5:30,1736-1751,,6,78,,Ecology,BULLFROG (RANA CATESBEIANA) INVASION OF A CALIFORNIA RIVER,,,,,,,,,,,,ESA Journals,,,,,,California; Hyla regilla; Rana boylii; Rana catesbeiana; Rivers; algae; biological invasions; grazing; size-structured competition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Algae initially grow as turfs, attached to the river bed, but over time detach to form floating mats. Floating mats differ from attached turfs as habitats for invertebrates in a number of respects. In paired trials, larval chironomids were 15-16 times more likely to be consumed by fishes when exposed in algal turfs on the river bed than when exposed in floating algal mats on the river surface. On average, 2.7 and 6.1 times more adult insects emerged from floating mats than from benthic algal turfs in shallow (< 30 cm deep) and deep (30-60 cm deep) habitats, respectively.

In a nitrogen (N)-limited river subject to Mediterranean summer drought hydrology, the colour of macroalgal proliferations changed with successional and seasonal changes in epiphyte assemblages. New growth of the dominant macroalga, Cladophora glomerata, was green, as were proliferations of Oedogonium, Mougeotia and Spirogyra, which did not become heavily colonized with diatoms. Green Cladophora turned yellow as Cladophora filaments became colonized by diatoms that were not N fixers, and turned rust-coloured as later-successional epiphyte assemblages became dominated by dense Epithemia turgida and E. sorex, which both contain N-fixing cyanobacterial endosymbionts.2. The rate and composition of insect emergence from floating algal mats differed among proliferations of different colour. The rates of emergence (individuals day−1 500 cm−2) of nematoceran flies were three to 25 times greater from yellow or rusty-coloured Cladophora mats than from green Cladophora, Oedogonium or Mougeotia mats that had lower epiphyte densities. Biomass emergence from Cladophora mats that were rusty in colour was eight to 10 times greater than from yellow Cladophora mats, because larger nematocerans dominated in rusty mats (Chironominae versus Ceratopogonidae in yellow mats).3. Proliferations of Epithemia-infested Cladophora occur at and above drainage areas of about 100 km2 (channel widths of 25–30 m) in this river network, coinciding with the drainage area threshold where a step increase in concentration of total dissolved N is observed during summer.4. In rivers under Mediterranean climate regimes, algal succession during the prolonged low flow season is less subject to stochastic interruption by spates than in rivers under more continental climates. Under these summer drought conditions, photogrammetric detection of colour changes in algal proliferations may help us track reach or basin-scale change in their ecological functions.",2009,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:19Z,1/19/2013 8:25,2101-2115,,10,54,,,Algal mats and insect emergence in rivers under Mediterranean climates,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,algae; epiphytic algae; insect emergence; nitrogen fixers; photogrammetric surveillance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the extent to which periphyton distribution and stream ecosystem metabolism in a steep upland river drainage network could be predicted from physical conditions that varied with local topography. During the summers of 2003 and 2004, we measured periphyton standing crops and gross primary production and ecosystem respiration rates along a 5 km reach of the South Fork Eel River and six of its tributaries in northern California (39°44′N, 123°39′W). We also measured wetted stream width (B), cross-sectionally averaged stream velocity (U), and streambed photosynthetically active solar radiation (PAR) at each site to investigate the degree to which periphyton abundance and metabolism were related to these indicators, which in turn are partially predictable from models relating environmental parameters to the topographic settings. Dimensional analysis, a technique widely used in the field of fluid mechanics, was used to investigate how biotic and abiotic variables may be interconnected in stream environments. Nondimensional groups of variables were formulated on the basis of our field estimates of chosen biotic and abiotic variables. Periphyton biomass was controlled by B9/5, exposure to light PAR1/5, nutrient concentration N5/6, and inverse stream depth H−5/6 and U−1/2. The autotrophic-heterotrophic balance, quantified by the gross primary production to ecosystem respiration rate, scaled with the stream aspect ratio (B/H) and Peclet number Pe = (UB/u*H), where u* is the shear stress velocity. The scaling relationships were validated against reported field measurements from other geographical areas. The results show nonlinear dependencies among periphyton biomass, stream metabolism, and abiotic variables. These nonlinear relationships point to a need for detailed quantification of biotic and abiotic variables over a range of scales.",2007,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:17Z,1/19/2013 9:24,n/a-n/a,,8,43,,,Abiotic controls on periphyton accrual and metabolism in streams,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,P/R ratio; dimensional analysis; metabolism; periphyton; stream velocity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Densities of these midges and their effects on Cladophora vary over time (seasonally, over the course of succession, and interannually) and space (down the drainage network). New Cladophora growth is green, turns yellow with early colonization by a monolayer of Cocconeis, and rusty-red as it becomes heavily epiphytized by a multistory layer of Epithemia spp. (Rhopalodiaceae), diatoms that contain N-fixing endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. To determine how midges influence epiphyte assemblage structure, we incubated Cladophora in early (green [G]), mid (yellow [Y]), and late (rusty-red [R]) stages of succession with and without midges and assessed changes in epiphyte density and composition. Midge effects on epiphyte composition and density (as measured by % cover on Cladophora filaments) varied with stage of succession and proximity to the ends of midge retreats. Local increases in retreat-associated cyanobacteria occurred in Y and R stages. Percent cover of Cocconeis increased on Y filaments >2 cm from midge retreats (ambient) indicating indirect midge effects (e.g., fertilization). Midges were less effective grazers on adnate Cocconeis cells than on loosely attached Epithemia and often ingested Cladophora in the process of grazing or retreat building, especially in G and Y stages. In contrast, midges that grazed on R Cladophora primarily consumed diatoms in the Rhopalodiaceae. Midge survival and retreat quality were lower in G than in Y or R stages, where retreats were longer and denser.

The weaving of this tapestry is a metaphor for species interactions, which can be divided into three broad classes: competitive, mutualistic, and consumptive. Direct interactions link together as more complex networks, for example, the joining of consumptive interactions into food webs. Food web dynamics are driven, in turn, by changes in the abundances of web members, whose numbers or biomass respond to bottom-up (resource limitation) and top-down (consumer limitation) forcing. The relative strengths of top-down and bottom-up forcing on the abundance of a given web member depend on its ecological context, including its topological position within the food web. Top-down effects by diverse consumers are nearly ubiquitous, in many cases influencing the structure and operation of ecosystems. While the ecological effects of such interactions are well known, far less is known of their evolutionary consequences. In this essay, we describe sundry consequences of these interaction chains on species and ecosystem processes, explain several known or suspected evolutionary effects of consumer-induced interaction chains, and identify areas where reciprocity between ecology and evolution involving the indirect effects of consumer-prey interaction chains might be further explored.",2013-05,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/18/2022 16:23,S76-S99,,S1,181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon),,Publisher: The University of Chicago Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report stable mercury (Hg) isotope compositions in food webs in a river and an adjacent forest in northern California and demonstrate the utility of Hg isotopes for studying MeHg sources and cross-habitat transfers. We observed large differences in both δ202Hg (mass-dependent fractionation) and ?199Hg (mass-independent fractionation) within both food webs. The majority of isotopic variation within each food web could be accounted for by differing proportions of inorganic Hg [Hg(II)] and MeHg along food chains. We estimated mean isotope values of Hg(II) and MeHg in each habitat and found a large difference in δ202Hg between Hg(II) and MeHg (?2.7?) in the forest but not in the river (?0.25?). This is consistent with in situ Hg(II) methylation in the study river but suggests Hg(II) methylation may not be important in the forest. In fact, the similarity in δ202Hg between MeHg in forest food webs and Hg(II) in precipitation suggests that MeHg in forest food webs may be derived from atmospheric sources (e.g., rainfall, fog). Utilizing contrasting δ202Hg values between MeHg in river food webs (?1.0?) and MeHg in forest food webs (+0.7?), we estimate with a two-source mixing model that ?55% of MeHg in two riparian spiders is derived from riverine sources while ?45% of MeHg originates from terrestrial sources. Thus, stable Hg isotopes can provide new information on subtle differences in sources of MeHg and trace MeHg transfers within and among food webs in natural ecosystems.",10/16/2012,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,3/31/2014 6:00,10957-10964,,20,46,,Environ.

Lakes have been extensively studied for MeHg photodegradation, but much less is known about streams, mainly because of the heterogeneity in sunlight availability along stream reaches and because there has been a lack of tools with which to integrate this longitudinal variability. We utilize odd-mass anomalies of stable Hg isotopes (i.e., Δ199Hg) as a proxy for estimating the relative extent of MeHg photodegradation in streams. In a northern California stream network, levels of MeHg in water and biota increased with increasing stream size in headwater and intermediate streams (drainage areas ranging from 0.6 to 150 km2), but MeHg levels decreased substantially in larger streams (drainage areas up to 1212 km2). In smaller streams, the increase of MeHg levels is attributed to increasing in situ MeHg production and is accompanied by only a small increase in Δ199Hg, indicating that the rate of MeHg photodegradation is low relative to the rate of in situ MeHg production. In larger streams, decreasing MeHg levels coincided with significant increases in Δ199Hg of MeHg (an average increase of 1.5‰ ± 0.5‰, n = 4), indicating that increasing MeHg photodegradation reduced MeHg levels in these wider, more open channels. Our findings clearly indicate that increasing sunlight availability in stream channels substantially increases MeHg photodegradation, which can reduce MeHg contamination in stream food webs.",2013,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,3/31/2014 5:57,13-22,,1,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CrossRef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ecological models of these processes often require data at the watershed scale. GIS-based solar models that predict insolation at the watershed scale take topographic shading into account, but do not account for vegetative shading. Most methods that quantify subcanopy insolation do so only at a single point. Further, subcanopy model calibration requires significant field effort and knowledge of characteristics (species composition, leaf area index & mean leaf angle for each species), and upscaling to watersheds is a significant source of uncertainty. We propose an approach to modeling insolation that uses airborne LiDAR data to estimate canopy openness as a Light Penetration Index (LPI). We couple LPI with the GRASS GIS r.sun solar model to produce the Subcanopy Solar Radiation model (SSR). SSR accounts for both topographic shading and vegetative shading at a landscape scale. After calibrating the r.sun model to a weather station at our study site, we compare SSR model predictions to black thermopile pyranometer field measurements and to hemispherical photographs using Gap Light Analyzer software, a standard method for point estimation of subcanopy radiation. Both SSR and hemispherical models exhibit a similar linear relationship with pyranometer data, and the models predict similar total solar radiation flux across the range of canopy openness. This approach allows prediction of light regimes at watershed scales with resolution that was previously possible only for local point measurements.",11/1/2014,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/17/2022 18:10,387-397,,,154,,Remote Sensing of Environment,Subcanopy Solar Radiation model,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Angelo Reserve; Insolation; Irradiance; LiDAR; Radiative transfer; Solar model; Subcanopy; Vegetation shading; Watershed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we use a new analytical technique to solve the linearized hillslope Boussinesq equation to predict water table dynamics and hillslope discharge to channels. The new solutions extend previous analytical treatments of the linearized hillslope Boussinesq equation to account for the impact of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in water table recharge. The results indicate that the spatial character of recharge may significantly alter both steady state subsurface storage characteristics and the transient hillslope hydrologic response, depending strongly on similarity measures of controls on the subsurface flow dynamics. Additionally, we derive new analytical solutions for the linearized hillslope-storage Boussinesq equation and explore the interaction effects of recharge structure and hillslope morphology on water storage and base flow recession characteristics. A theoretical recession analysis, for example, demonstrates that decreasing the relative amount of downslope recharge has a similar effect as increasing hillslope convergence.

However, controlling processes for the hydrochemistry dynamics in this zone are poorly understood. This work reports the first results from a four-year (2009–2012) high-frequency (1–3day) monitoring of major solutes (Ca, Mg, Na, K and Si) in the perched, dynamic groundwater in a 4000m2 zero-order basin located at the Angelo Coast Range Reserve, Northern California. Groundwater samples were autonomously collected at three wells (downslope, mid-slope, and upslope) aligned with the axis of the drainage. Rain and throughfall samples, profiles of well headspace pCO2, vertical profiles and time series of groundwater temperature, and contemporaneous data from an extensive hydrologic and climate sensor network provided the framework for data analysis. All runoff at this soil-mantled site occurs by vertical unsaturated flow through a 5–25m thick weathered argillite and then by lateral flows to the adjacent channel as groundwater perched over fresher bedrock. Driven by strongly seasonal rainfall, over each of the four years of observations, the hydrochemistry of the groundwater at each well repeats an annual cycle, which can be explained by two end-member processes. The first end-member process, which dominates during the winter high-flow season in mid- and upslope areas, is CO2 enhanced cation exchange reaction in the vadose zone in the more shallow conductive weathered bedrock. This process rapidly increases the cation concentrations of the infiltrated rainwater, which is responsible for the lowest cation concentration of groundwater. The second-end member process occurs in the deeper perched groundwater and either dominates year-round (at the downslope well) or becomes progressively dominant during low flow season at the two upper slope wells. This process is the equilibrium reaction with minerals such as calcite and clay minerals, but not with primary minerals, suggesting the critical role of the residence time of the water. Collectively, our measurements reveal that the hydrochemistry dynamics of the groundwater in the weathered bedrock zone is governed by two end-member processes whose dominance varies with critical zone structure, the relative importance of vadose versus groundwater zone processes, and thus with the seasonal variation of the chemistry of recharge and runoff.",9/1/2014,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/17/2022 18:11,19-Jan,,,140,,Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,ERCZO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigate the seasonality of evergreen tree transpiration in a Mediterranean climate, using observations from a small (4000 m2), forested, steep (32°) hillslope, in the northern California Coast Range. We analyze 3 years of half-hourly measurements from 39 sap flow sensors in 26 trees, six depth profiles of soil moisture measured by TDR, and spatially distributed measurements of micrometeorology from five locations. The sap flow measurements show that two common evergreen tree species have different seasons of peak transpiration. Douglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii) maintain significant transpiration through the winter rainy season and transpire maximally in the spring, followed by a sharp decline in transpiration in the summer dry season. Pacific madrones (Arbutus menziesii), and to a lesser extent other broadleaf evergreen species (Quercus wislizeni, Notholithocarpus densiflorus, Umbellularia californica), in contrast, transpire maximally in the summer dry season. The seasonal patterns are quantified using principal component analysis. Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation of response to environmental variables shows that the difference in transpiration seasonality arises from different sensitivities to atmospheric evaporative demand and root-zone moisture. The different sensitivities to atmospheric evaporative demand also create species differences in transpiration variability at synoptic time scales. Using the sap flow measurements and a regional forest inventory, a bottom-up regional transpiration estimate is constructed. The estimate suggests that sensitivity of Douglas-fir transpiration to water stress suppresses dry season evapotranspiration at the regional scale.",2014,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/17/2022 18:11,1869-1894,,3,50,,,Species differences in the seasonality of evergreen tree transpiration in a Mediterranean climate,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2013WR014023,,,,ERCZO; Mediterranean climate; evapotranspiration; forest drought response; sap flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, understanding of the microbiology of this process is limited because most culture-independent methods cannot link metabolic processes to the organisms present, and this link to causative agents is necessary to predict the results of perturbations on the system. We collected soil samples at two sub-root depths (10–20 cm and 30–40 cm) before and after a rainfall-driven nutrient perturbation event in a Northern California grassland that experiences a Mediterranean climate. From ten samples, we reconstructed 198 metagenome-assembled genomes that represent all major phylotypes. We also quantified 6,835 proteins and 175 metabolites and showed that after the rain event the concentrations of many sugars and amino acids approach zero at the base of the soil profile. Unexpectedly, the genomes of novel members of the Gemmatimonadetes and Candidate Phylum Rokubacteria phyla encode pathways for methylotrophy. We infer that these abundant organisms contribute substantially to carbon turnover in the soil, given that methylotrophy proteins were among the most abundant proteins in the proteome. Previously undescribed Bathyarchaeota and Thermoplasmatales archaea are abundant in deeper soil horizons and are inferred to contribute appreciably to aromatic amino acid degradation. Many of the other bacteria appear to breakdown other components of plant biomass, as evidenced by the prevalence of various sugar and amino acid transporters and corresponding hydrolyzing machinery in the proteome. Overall, our work provides organism-resolved insight into the spatial distribution of bacteria and archaea whose activities combine to degrade plant-derived organics, limiting the transport of methanol, amino acids and sugars into underlying weathered rock. The new insights into the soil carbon cycle during an intense period of carbon turnover, including biogeochemical roles to previously little known soil microbes, were made possible via the combination of metagenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.",11/8/2016,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/15/2022 20:16,e2687,,,4,,PeerJ,,,,,,,,en,,,,,peerj.com,,Publisher: PeerJ Inc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying how chemical erosion rates vary with climate and tectonics is therefore vital to understanding feedbacks that have maintained Earth's environment within a habitable range over geologic time. If chemical erosion rates are strongly influenced by the availability of fresh minerals for dissolution, then there should be strong connections between climate, which is modulated by chemical erosion, and tectonic uplift, which supplies fresh minerals to Earth's surface. This condition, referred to as supply-limited chemical erosion, implies strong tectonic control of chemical erosion rates. It differs from kinetic-limited chemical erosion, in which dissolution kinetics and thus climatic factors are the dominant regulators of chemical erosion rates. Here we present a statistical method for determining whether chemical erosion of silicate-rich bedrock is supply limited or kinetic limited, as an approach for revealing the relative importance of tectonics and climate in Earth's silicate weathering thermostat. We applied this method to published data sets of mineral supply rates and regolith chemical depletion and were unable to reject the null hypothesis that chemical erosion is supply limited in 8 of 16 cases. In seven of the remaining eight cases, we found behavior that is closer to supply limited than kinetic limited, suggesting that tectonics may often dominate over climate in regulating chemical erosion rates. However, statistical power analysis shows that new measurements across a wider range of supply rates are needed to help quantify feedbacks between climate and tectonics in Earth's long-term climatic evolution.",2016,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/15/2022 20:17,2270-2285,,6,17,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016GC006273,,,,,chemical erosion; climate; kinetic-limited; supply-limited; tectonics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W3H6C8AY,thesis,2017,"Bouma-Gregson, Keith","The Ecology of Benthic Toxigenic Anabaena and Phormidium (Cyanobacteria) in the Eel River, California",,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1z3313kj,"Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems across the earth. In many environments they are present at low abundances, however under certain environmental conditions cyanobacteria bloom and become one of the dominant organisms in an waterbody, degrading aquatic food webs and water quality. Cyanobacteria evolved over 2 billion years ago, and cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) have been documented for decades. Of particular concern is the production of cyanotoxins, secondary metabolites toxic to humans and other organisms, by certain strains of cyanobacteria. Most research of cyanoHABs has been of planktonic blooms in lakes or estuaries, and cyanotoxin production by benthic cyanobacteria in rivers has been more recent, but in many rivers benthic cyanobacteria are the primary source of cyanotoxins. With field surveys and monitoring, manipulative field experiments, and genome-resolved metagenomics, this dissertation investigated the ecology of benthic cyanobacteria in the Eel River, California.Like most coastal rivers in Northern California, the Eel River is in a Mediterranean climate. During the seasonal summer drought rivers become shallow, slow flowing, and warm, excellent habitat for benthic algal production. Non-toxic benthic algae are consumed by vertebrate and invertebrate grazers and are foundational to the aquatic summer food web. However, these benthic algal assemblages can tip towards toxicity when cyanobacteria begin to dominate the assemblage. Over a dozen dogs have died in the Eel River since the year 2000 due to ingesting cyanobacteria. Neighboring watersheds have also experienced dog deaths from cyanotoxin poisoning, and benthic cyanobacterial mats are an increasing public health concern in multiple Northern California rivers. Prior to this dissertation there were few data on the distribution and ecology of benthic toxigenic cyanobacteria in California rivers. During the summers of 2013-2015, I documented spatial and temporal patterns of cyanobacterial occurrence and cyanotoxin concentrations in the watershed, showing widespread distribution of anatoxin-a produced by benthic cyanobacteria. Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed weekly to record dissolved microcystin and anatoxin-a levels at 10 sites throughout the watershed, and 187 cyanobacterial mat samples were collected from 31 sites to measure intracellular anatoxin-a and microcystins. Anatoxin-a levels were higher than microcystin for both SPATT and cyanobacterial mat samples. Species of benthic Anabaena and Phormidium were frequently found to produce cyanotoxins in the Eel watershed. Of the benthic mats sampled, 50% had detectable anatoxin-a (mean µg g-1 DW= 1.71, max= 70.93), while 24% had detectable microcystins (mean µg g-1 DW= 0.067, max= 2.29). SPATT cyanotoxin levels peaked in mid-summer in warm mainstem reaches of the watershed. This is one of the first documentations of widespread anatoxin-a occurrence and anatoxin-a production by benthic cyanobacterial mats in a North American watershed.Field experiments were used to study the buoyancy of benthic Anabaena spp. mats to understand implications for Anabaena dispersal. Experiments addressed oxygen bubble production and dissolution on the buoyancy of Anabaena dominated benthic mats in response to light exposure. Samples of Anabaena dominated mats were harvested from the South Fork Eel River and placed in settling columns to measure floating and sinking velocities, or deployed into in situ ambient and low light treatments to measure the effect of light on flotation. Floating and sinking occurred within minutes and were driven by oxygen bubbles produced during photosynthesis, rather than intracellular changes in carbohydrates or gas vesicles. Light experiment results showed that in a natural ambient light regime, mats remained floating for at least 4 days, while in low light mats begin to sink in &lt;24 hours. The ability of Anabaena mats to maintain their buoyancy will markedly increase their downstream dispersal distances. Increased buoyancy also allows toxin-containing mats to collect along shorelines, increasing threats to human and animal public health.Within cyanobacterial mats are a consortia of microbes interacting together to process and exchange molecules to maintain their growth. Currently, little is known about the diversity of the biosynthetic capacities of cyanobacterial species and associated microbes in freshwater benthic mats in rivers. I sampled 22 Phormidium mats collected across the Eel River network and used genome-resolved metagenomics to 1) investigate cyanobacterial and co-occurring microbial assemblage diversity, 2) probe their metabolic potential, and 3) evaluate their capacities for toxin production. From the genomes of seven strains from one species group we describe the first anatoxin-a operon from the genus Phormidium. Importantly, community composition within the mat appears to be associated with the presence of cyanobacteria capable of producing anatoxin-a. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and novel Verrucomicrobia dominated the microbial assemblages. Interestingly, some mats also contained Candidate Phylum Kapabacteria and Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria from Absconditabacteria (SR1), Parcubacteria (OD1) and Doudnabacteria (SM2F11). Although the majority of genomes were unique to a particular sample, metabolic diversity was low across samples. In addition to oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon respiration, metabolic capacities include aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, sulfur compound oxidation and breakdown of urea. These results show the importance of organic carbon and nitrogen to energy flow and nutrient cycling within mats and the interactions between potential anatoxin-a production and microbial assemblage composition.By combining watershed-scale observations, field experiments, and genomic analyses this dissertation provides novel information about the ecology of toxigenic benthic cyanobacteria in California rivers. Comprehensive knowledge of the ecology of benthic cyanobacteria is necessary to understand it’s impacts to public and ecosystem health and to better predict where and when blooms might occur in rivers.",2017,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/22/2022 20:52,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Berkeley,,en,,,,,escholarship.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To encourage exploration of the character and implications of interactions between trees and soil in the CZ, we propose nine hypotheses that can be tested at diverse settings. The hypotheses are roughly divided into those about the architecture (building) and those about the water (plumbing) in the CZ, but the two functions are intertwined. Depending upon one's disciplinary background, many of the nine hypotheses listed below may appear obviously true or obviously false. (1) Tree roots can only physically penetrate and biogeochemically comminute the immobile substrate underlying mobile soil where that underlying substrate is fractured or pre-weathered. (2) In settings where the thickness of weathered material, <i>H</i>, is large, trees primarily shape the CZ through biogeochemical reactions within the rooting zone. (3) In forested uplands, the thickness of mobile soil, <i>h</i>, can evolve toward a steady state because of feedbacks related to root disruption and tree throw. (4) In settings where <i>h</i>&thinsp;≪&thinsp;<i>H</i> and the rates of uplift and erosion are low, the uptake of phosphorus into trees is buffered by the fine-grained fraction of the soil, and the ultimate source of this phosphorus is dust. (5) In settings of limited water availability, trees maintain the highest length density of functional roots at depths where water can be extracted over most of the growing season with the least amount of energy expenditure. (6) Trees grow the majority of their roots in the zone where the most growth-limiting resource is abundant, but they also grow roots at other depths to forage for other resources and to hydraulically redistribute those resources to depths where they can be taken up more efficiently. (7) Trees rely on matrix water in the unsaturated zone that at times may have an isotopic composition distinct from the gravity-drained water that transits from the hillslope to groundwater and streamflow. (8) Mycorrhizal fungi can use matrix water directly, but trees can only use this water by accessing it indirectly through the fungi. (9) Even trees growing well above the valley floor of a catchment can directly affect stream chemistry where changes in permeability near the rooting zone promote intermittent zones of water saturation and downslope flow of water to the stream. By testing these nine hypotheses, we will generate important new cross-disciplinary insights that advance CZ science.</p>",11/17/2017,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/15/2022 19:57,5115-5142,,22,14,,,Reviews and syntheses,,,,,,,English,,,,,bg.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Annual or seasonal hydrologic variables are themselves the integral of instantaneous variations and can be well approximated as an aggregate sum of the daily variable. Process-based, probabilistic techniques are available to describe the stochastic structure of daily flow, yet estimating interannual variations in the corresponding aggregated variable requires consideration of the autocorrelation structure of the flow time series. Here we present a method based on a probabilistic streamflow description to obtain the interannual variability of flow-derived variables.

Terrestrially derived dissolved organic carbon (t-DOC) inputs can modify light availability, the spatial distribution of primary production, heat, and oxygen in aquatic systems, as well as inorganic nutrient bioavailability. It is also well-established that some terrestrial inputs (such as invertebrates and fruits) provide high-quality food resources for consumers in some systems. In small to moderate-sized streams, leaf litter inputs average approximately three times greater than the autochthonous production. Conversely, in oligo/mesotrophic lakes algal production is typically five times greater than the available flux of allochthonous basal resources. Terrestrial particulate organic carbon (t-POC) inputs to lakes and rivers are comprised of 80%–90% biochemically recalcitrant lignocellulose, which is highly resistant to enzymatic breakdown by animal consumers. Further, t-POC and heterotrophic bacteria lack essential biochemical compounds that are critical for rapid growth and reproduction in aquatic invertebrates and fishes. Several studies have directly shown that these resources have very low food quality for herbivorous zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Much of the nitrogen assimilated by stream consumers is probably of algal origin, even in systems where there appears to be a significant terrestrial carbon contribution. Amino acid stable isotope analyses for large river food webs indicate that most upper trophic level essential amino acids are derived from algae. Similarly, profiles of essential fatty acids in consumers show a strong dependence on the algal food resources. Primary production to respiration ratios are not a meaningful index to assess consumer allochthony because respiration represents an oxidised carbon flux that cannot be utilised by animal consumers. Rather, the relative importance of allochthonous subsidies for upper trophic level production should be addressed by considering the rates at which terrestrial and autochthonous resources are consumed and the growth efficiency supported by this food. Ultimately, the biochemical composition of a particular basal resource, and not just its quantity or origin, determines how readily this material is incorporated into upper trophic level consumers. Because of its highly favourable biochemical composition and greater availability, we conclude that microalgal production supports most animal production in freshwater ecosystems.",2017,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/17/2022 18:36,833-853,,5,62,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/fwb.12909,,,,,allochthonous; autochthonous; biochemical composition; freshwater; resource utilisation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model includes a stochastic parameterization of hydraulic conductivity, root water uptake efficiency, and hydraulic redistribution by plant roots. Model experiments vary the precipitation, the magnitude and seasonality of ET demand, as well as rooting profiles and rooting depths of the vegetation. The results show that the amount of subsurface moisture remaining at the end of the wet winter is determined by the competition among abundant precipitation input, fast infiltration, and winter ET demand. The weathered bedrock retains of the winter rain and provides a substantial moisture reservoir that may sustain ET of deep-rooted (>8 m) trees through the dry season. A small negative feedback exists in the root zone, where the depletion of moisture by ET decreases hydraulic conductivity and enhances the retention of moisture.

Most known antibiotics are derived from a few culturable microbial taxa3, and the biosynthetic potential of the vast majority of bacteria in soil has rarely been investigated4. Here we reconstruct hundreds of near-complete genomes from grassland soil metagenomes and identify microorganisms from previously understudied phyla that encode diverse polyketide and nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene clusters that are divergent from well-studied clusters. These biosynthetic loci are encoded by newly identified members of the Acidobacteria, Verrucomicobia and Gemmatimonadetes, and the candidate phylum Rokubacteria. Bacteria from these groups are highly abundant in soils5–7, but have not previously been genomically linked to secondary metabolite production with confidence. In particular, large numbers of biosynthetic genes were characterized in newly identified members of the Acidobacteria, which is the most abundant bacterial phylum across soil biomes5. We identify two acidobacterial genomes from divergent lineages, each of which encodes an unusually large repertoire of biosynthetic genes with up to fifteen large polyketide and nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic loci per genome. To track gene expression of genes encoding polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases in the soil ecosystem that we studied, we sampled 120 time points in a microcosm manipulation experiment and, using metatranscriptomics, found that gene clusters were differentially co-expressed in response to environmental perturbations. Transcriptional co-expression networks for specific organisms associated biosynthetic genes with two-component systems, transcriptional activation, putative antimicrobial resistance and iron regulation, linking metabolite biosynthesis to processes of environmental sensing and ecological competition. We conclude that the biosynthetic potential of abundant and phylogenetically diverse soil microorganisms has previously been underestimated.

Here, we propose that discharge is explicitly sensitive to changes in only some fraction of seasonally dynamic storage that we call “direct storage,” whereas the remaining storage (“indirect storage”) varies without directly influencing discharge. We use a coupled mass balance and storage–discharge function approach to partition seasonally dynamic storage between these 2 pools in the Northern California Coast Ranges. We find that indirect storage constitutes the vast majority of dynamic catchment storage, even at the wettest times of the year. Indirect storage exhibits lower variability over the course of the wet season (and in successive winter periods) than does direct storage. Predicted indirect storage volumes and dynamics match field observations. Comparison of 2 neighbouring field sites reveals that indirect storage volumes can occur as unsaturated storage held under tension in soils and weathered bedrock and as near-surface saturated storage that remains on hillslopes (and is eventually evapotranspired). Indirect storage volumes (including moisture in the weathered bedrock) may support plant transpiration, and our method indicates that this important water source could be quantified from precipitation and stream discharge records.",2018,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/15/2022 19:49,1978-1992,,13,32,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.11627,,,,ERCZO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using Ti normalization, CZOs with <12% rock-derived Hg (Boulder Creek, Calhoun, and Southern Sierra) had Hg peaks between 1.5 and 8.0 m in depth. At CZOs with >50% rock-derived Hg, Eel River Hg concentrations and pools were greatest at >4.0 m in the weathering profile, while Luquillo and Shale Hills had peaks at the surface that diminished within 1.0 m of the surface. Hg and total organic C were only significantly correlated in regolith at Luquillo and Shale Hills CZOs, suggesting that Hg sorption to organic matter may be less dominant than clays or Fe(II) sulfides in deeper regolith. Our results demonstrate the importance of Hg sequestration in deep regolith, below typical soil sampling depths.",2018,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/15/2022 19:52,1542-1555,,10,32,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2018GB005974,,,,,critical zone; excess mercury; mercury cycling; mercury inventories; regolith; soil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These variations arise from strong north-south, east-west gradients in rainfall and vegetation, strong interannual variability in rainfall (±30%) and strong seasonal variability in the supply and demand for moisture. We used the Breathing Earth System Simulator to evaluate the rates and sums of evaporation across California, over the 2001–2017 period. Breathing Earth System Simulator is a bottom-up, biophysical model that couples subroutines that calculate the surface energy balance, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance. The model is forced with high-resolution remote sensing data (1 km).The questions we address are as follows: How much water is evaporated across the natural and managed ecosystems of California? How much does evaporation vary during the booms and busts in annual rainfall? and Is evaporation increasing with time due to a warming climate? Mean annual evaporation, averaged over the 2001–2017 period, was relatively steady (393 ± 21 mm/year) given the high interannual variation in precipitation (519 ± 140 mm/year). No significant trend in evaporation at the statewide level was detected over this time period, despite a background of a warming climate. Irrigated agricultural crops and orchards, at 1-km scale, use less water than inferred estimates for individual fields. This leaves the potential for sharing water, a scarce resource, more equitably among competing stakeholders, for example, farms, fish, people, and ecosystems.",2019,2/7/2024 6:45,2024-02-07T06:45:38Z,2/15/2022 19:42,2722-2741,,4,55,,,How Much Water Is Evaporated Across California?,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2018WR023884,,,,,AmeriFlux; MODIS; ecohydrology; evaporation; remote sensing; water budget,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As yet, we know little about how various benthic cyanobacteria are distributed in river networks, or how environmental conditions or other associated microbes in their consortia affect their biosynthetic capacities. We performed metagenomic sequencing for 22 Oscillatoriales-dominated (Cyanobacteria) microbial mats collected across the Eel River network in Northern California and investigated factors associated with anatoxin-a producing cyanobacteria. All microbial communities were dominated by one or two cyanobacterial species, so the key mat metabolisms involve oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon oxidation. Only a few metabolisms fueled the growth of the mat communities, with little evidence for anaerobic metabolic pathways. We genomically defined four cyanobacterial species, all which shared <96% average nucleotide identity with reference Oscillatoriales genomes and are potentially novel species in the genus Microcoleus. One of the Microcoleus species contained the anatoxin-a biosynthesis genes, and we describe the first anatoxin-a gene cluster from the Microcoleus clade within Oscillatoriales. Occurrence of these four Microcoleus species in the watershed was correlated with total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, and the species that contains the anatoxin-a gene cluster was found in sites with higher nitrogen concentrations. Microbial assemblages in mat samples with the anatoxin-a gene cluster consistently had a lower abundance of Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria) species than did mats without the anatoxin-producing genes.

Even Acidobacteria, among the most abundant bacteria in soil, remain poorly characterized, and functions across groups such as Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi and Rokubacteria are understudied. Here, we have resolved 60 metagenomic and 20 proteomic data sets from a Mediterranean grassland soil ecosystem and recovered 793 near-complete microbial genomes from 18 phyla, representing around one-third of all microorganisms detected. Importantly, this enabled extensive genomics-based metabolic predictions for these communities. Acidobacteria from multiple previously unstudied classes have genomes that encode large enzyme complements for complex carbohydrate degradation. Alternatively, most microorganisms encode carbohydrate esterases that strip readily accessible methyl and acetyl groups from polymers like pectin and xylan, forming methanol and acetate, the availability of which could explain the high prevalence of C1 metabolism and acetate utilization in genomes. Microorganism abundances among samples collected at three soil depths and under natural and amended rainfall regimes indicate statistically higher associations of inorganic nitrogen metabolism and carbon degradation in deep and shallow soils, respectively. This partitioning decreased in samples under extended spring rainfall, indicating that long-term climate alteration can affect both carbon and nitrogen cycling.

Here we bring together hydrologists, Critical Zone scientists, and ESM developers, to explore how hillslope structures may modulate ESM grid-level water, energy, and biogeochemical fluxes. In contrast to the one-dimensional (1-D), 2- to 3-m deep, and free-draining soil hydrology in most ESM land models, we hypothesize that 3-D, lateral ridge-to-valley flow through shallow and deep paths and insolation contrasts between sunny and shady slopes are the top two globally quantifiable organizers of water and energy (and vegetation) within an ESM grid cell. We hypothesize that these two processes are likely to impact ESM predictions where (and when) water and/or energy are limiting. We further hypothesize that, if implemented in ESM land models, these processes will increase simulated continental water storage and residence time, buffering terrestrial ecosystems against seasonal and interannual droughts. We explore efficient ways to capture these mechanisms in ESMs and identify critical knowledge gaps preventing us from scaling up hillslope to global processes. One such gap is our extremely limited knowledge of the subsurface, where water is stored (supporting vegetation) and released to stream baseflow (supporting aquatic ecosystems).

Flow duration curves (FDCs) succinctly capture this information using all data available over some historical period, while annual flow duration curves (AFDCs) instead use data from each individual water year. Analyzing the population of AFDCs, and in particular the tails of this distribution, can allow water managers to better prepare for years with extreme streamflow conditions. However, long time series of observations are necessary to capture interannual streamflow variations and are problematic to obtain in rapidly changing and poorly gauged catchments. By incorporating a process-based model to construct AFDCs based on daily rainfall statistics and flow recession characteristics, the proposed approach is a first step toward addressing this challenge. Results indicate that prediction performance varies substantially across flow quantiles and that the current model fails to properly capture the interannual variability of low flows. Numerical analyses attributed these errors to nonlinearity in storage-discharge relation, rather than cross-scale streamflow correlations and non-Poissonian rainfall, explaining the origin of commonly observed heavy-tailed behavior in low flow quantiles. We present a case study on hydroelectric power generation, showing that faithfully capturing both interannual streamflow variability and recession nonlinearity has important implications for installation profitability.",2019,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 19:45,6125-6137,,7,55,,,On the Effect of Nonlinear Recessions on Low Flow Variability,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2019WR024912,,,,,annual flow duration curves; flow duration curves; stochastics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The root-zone water storage capacity ( [L]) defines the maximum volume of water that can be stored in plant accessible locations in the subsurface, but is poorly characterized and difficult to measure at large scales. Here, we develop an ecohydrological modeling framework to describe how mediates root zone water storage (S [L]), and thus dry season plant water use. The model reveals that where is high relative to mean annual rainfall, S is not fully replenished in all years, and root-zone water storage and therefore plant water use are sensitive to annual rainfall. Conversely, where is low, S is replenished in most years but can be depleted rapidly between storm events, increasing plant sensitivity to rainfall patterns at the end of the wet season. In contrast to both the high and low cases, landscapes with intermediate values are predicted to minimize variability in dry season evapotranspiration. These diverse plant behaviors enable a mapping between time variations in precipitation, evapotranspiration and , which makes it possible to estimate using remotely sensed vegetation data − that is, using plants as sensors. We test the model using observations of in soils and weathered bedrock at two sites in the Northern California Coast Ranges.

Organismal co-occurrence sets the stage for biotic interactions, which can feed back to control the distribution and abundance of interacting species in ecological communities. Classically, competition and bottom-up forces have been thought to be the most important drivers of community structure, however, examples of predation, parasitism, mutualism, and facilitation highlight the ubiquity and importance of these other interactions. In freshwaters, anthropogenic impacts, especially species introductions and climate warming, have resulted in novel species assemblages, with altered webs of interactions compared to historic conditions. Human management often seeks to provide conditions that favor native species and inhibit non-natives. Success requires an understanding species interactions and their roles in community dynamics. In my first chapter, I describe the distributional dynamics of the assemblage of aquatic fishes, reptiles and amphibians in the South Fork Eel River. In Chapter 2, I describe the seasonal migration of an introduced predatory fish, Sacramento Pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), and how climate warming and water withdrawals could increase their negative impact on rearing native salmonids and other fauna. In Chapter 3, my colleagues and I explore the positive interactions between Pacific Lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus), juvenile Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and Foothill Yellow-legged Frogs (Rana boylii).

We document water source use of Quercus garryana growing in Northern California on a profile of approximately 50 cm of soil underlain by 2–4 m of weathered bedrock (sheared shale mélange) that completely saturates in winter, when the oaks lack leaves, and progressively dries over the summer. We determined oak water sources by combining observations of water stable isotope composition, vadose zone moisture and groundwater dynamics, and metrics of tree water status (potential) and use (sapflow). During the spring, oak xylem water is isotopically similar to the seasonal groundwater and shallow, evaporatively enriched soil moisture pools. However, as soils dry and the water table recedes to the permanently saturated, anoxic, low-conductivity fresh bedrock boundary, Q. garryana shifts to using a water source with a depleted isotopic composition that matches residual moisture in the deep soil and underlying weathered bedrock vadose zone. Sapflow rates remain high as late-summer predawn water potentials drop below −2.5 MPa. Neutron probe surveys reveal late-summer rock moisture declines under the oaks in contrast to constant rock moisture levels under grass-dominated areas. We therefore conclude that the oaks temporarily use seasonal groundwater when it occupies the weathered profile but otherwise use deep unsaturated zone moisture after seasonal groundwater recedes.

We also observed a strong relationship between distance upstream and proportion of migratory alleles. In Fox Creek, the primary barrier is at the mouth, and we found that the migratory allele frequency varied with the annual timing of high flow events. In years when rain events occurred during the peak breeding season, migratory allele frequency was high (60%–68%), but otherwise it was low (30% in two years).

We studied the ecological consequences of partial migration in a salmonid fish, Oncorhynchus mykiss, in coastal streams in California, USA. One ecotype, steelhead trout, migrates to the ocean, whereas the other, rainbow trout, completes its lifecycle in freshwater. Migration has a strong genetic basis in O. mykiss. In one stream, we found differences in the frequency of migration-linked genotypes below and above a waterfall barrier (migratory allele frequency of 60% below vs. 31% above). Below the waterfall, in the migratory-dominated region, the density of young fish (<1 yr old) was approximately twice that in the resident-dominated region above the waterfall (0.46 vs. 0.26 individuals/m2, respectively), presumably reflecting the higher fecundity of migratory females. Additionally, there were half as many older fish (>1 yr old) in pools downstream of the waterfall (0.05 vs. 0.13 individuals/m2). In a second stream, between-year variation in the dominance of migratory vs. resident fish allowed us to explore differences in fish density and size structure through time, and we found a consistent pattern. In brief, when migratory genotypes dominated, we found higher densities of young fish and lower densities of older fish, resulting in a simpler size structure, compared to when resident genotypes dominated. Moreover, large resident trout had a slightly higher trophic position than young fish (3.92 vs. 3.42 in one creek and 3.77 vs. 3.17 in the other), quantified with stable isotope data.

In a variety of settings, water is stored in fractured and weathered bedrock as rock moisture. However, few techniques are available to measure rock moisture in unsaturated rock, making direct estimates of water storage dynamics difficult to obtain. Here, we use borehole nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at two sites in seasonally dry California to quantify dynamic rock moisture storage.

Seasonal variation in thermal environments can vary across years and among sites. We investigated how organisms with annual life cycles respond to predictable seasonal changes in temperature and unpredictable thermal variation between habitats and years throughout their lives. Field surveys and historical records reveal that the spatially and temporally heterogeneous thermal environments inhabited by the annual mayfly Ephemerella maculata (Ephemerellidae) shift the date for transition to the next, life stage, so that the thermal phenotype of each life stage matches the thermal environment of the specific habitat and year. Laboratory studies of three distinct life stages of this mayfly reveal that life stage transitions are temperature dependent, facilitating timing shifts that are synchronized with the current season’s temperatures. Each life stage exhibited specific thermal sensitivity and performance phenotypes that matched the ambient temperature typically experienced during that life stage. Our study across the whole life cycle reveals mechanisms that allow organisms to achieve lifetime eurythermy in a dynamic seasonal environment, despite having narrower thermal ranges for growth and development in each life stage.",3/1/2020,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 19:10,647-656,,3,192,,Oecologia,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,Aquatic insect; life cycle; season; stream; temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We made high-resolution in situ observations of air temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, insolation, and sap velocity observations on 14 Pacific madrone trees (Arbutus menziesii) spanning adjacent north and south slopes at the University of California's Angelo Coast Range Reserve. To understand the cross-slope response of sap velocity, a proxy for transpiration, to microclimate, we modeled the sap velocity on each slope using a transpiration model driven by ambient environment and parameterized with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation process. The results show that trees on opposing slopes do not follow a shared pattern of physiological response to transpiration drivers. This means that the observed sap velocity differences are not due entirely to observed microclimate differences, but also due to population-level physiological differences, which indicates acclimation to inhabited microclimate. While our present data set and analytical tools do not identify mechanisms of acclimation, we speculate that differing proportions of sun-adapted and shade-adapted leaves, differences in stomatal regulation, and cross-slope root zone moisture differences could explain some of the observed and modeled differences.",2021,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 1:33,e2020JG006027,,5,126,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020JG006027,,,,ERCZO,MCMC; plant acclimation; sap velocity; topographic effect; transpiration drivers; transpiration modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the drivers of the small-scale variation in algal taxonomic composition helps us predict the riverscape-scale effects of altered flow regimes, but microhabitat-scale variation in algal taxonomy complicates the interpretation of ecosystem-scale estimates of biomass or primary production. Using pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry, we performed 2 manipulative field experiments (in 2014 and 2015) to measure photosynthetic responses of algae and cyanobacteria to depth, temperature, and flow modifications. In 2014, we exposed 6 attached algal assemblages common to the South Fork Eel River (California, USA) to a 24-h incubation on either the river bottom (20 cm deep) or floating at the water surface. In 2015, we incubated 3 algal assemblages for 1 wk in either the thalweg or at the river’s edge. For PAM measurements, we developed a novel method (Photosynthesis–Irradiance Periphyton Experimental System [PIPES]) for manipulating attached filamentous algae, a morphology common in aquatic habitats but underrepresented in photosynthesis experiments. To make the PIPES, we sandwiched thin (<1 mm) layers of filamentous attached algae between 2 layers of mesh so that the algae could be isolated and manipulated for repeated PAM measurements. In the 2014 experiment, incubating Cladophora, Rivularia, Microcoleus, and Anabaena at the water surface tended to decrease photosynthetic rates relative to submerged controls, whereas for Nostoc, the photosynthetic rates were higher in floating treatments. In the 2015 experiment, Cladophora and Oedogonium incubated in the warmer, low-flow river margin had persistently lower photosynthesis rates than their counterparts incubated in the thalweg. The PIPES method improves our ability to make PAM measurements on attached algae. PIPES can be used in conjunction with other methods to evaluate taxon-specific responses to environmental conditions and to help us predict how algal assemblages will shift in dominance under different river management regimes.",2021-03,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 1:34,175-190,,1,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon),,Publisher: The University of Chicago Press,,,,,Cladophora; Microcoleus; PAM; algae; benthic; cyanobacteria; electron transport rate; flow; microhabitat; photosynthesis; temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fate and transport of these isotopes in the dissolved load of major rivers have been characterized to infer changes in both contemporary weathering regimes and paleo-conditions. In this contribution, we deconvolve this integrated signal into the individual processes that fractionate Li at the inception of silicate weathering by directly measuring Li isotope ratios of waters (δ7Li) transiting through a rapidly eroding first-order hillslope. We use these data to develop a multicomponent reactive transport framework, which shows that net dissolution of weathered material generates light δ7Li signatures (as low as −9.2‰) in the shallow portion of the vadose zone. An increase in δ7Li deeper into the vadose zone (as much as +18‰) reflects an increasing contribution of secondary mineral formation. Below the water table, congruent weathering occurs and imparts elevated cation concentrations and bedrock δ7Li. Silicate weathering continues within the saturated zone as groundwater travels downslope (δ7Li = +13 to + 24‰) to the stream. The stream signatures (δ7Li = +28 to +29‰) reflect the terminus of this network of silicate weathering reactions and the relative magnitude of each contributing process (e.g., transitions in secondary mineral formation, dissolution of weathered material). We show that fluid progressing through the weathering profile of this first-order hillslope is distinguished by a sequence of characteristic Li isotope signatures, which can be reproduced in a forward, process-based model framework. This model development offers an improved quantitative basis for the use of metal(loid) stable isotopes in disentangling catchment-scale chemical weathering fluxes.",8/1/2021,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 18:46,116988,,,567,,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,ERCZO,Critical Zone; lithium isotopes; reactive transport; silicate weathering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a survey of benthic POM-associated respiration and nutrient uptake as well as microbial biomass (bacteria and algae) and benthic POM composition in four size classes (0.7–53 μm, 53–106 μm, 106–250 μm, and 250–1000 μm) in six streams in the forested South Fork Eel River watershed (California), encompassing a longitudinal gradient in light availability and primary production. Benthic POM at downstream sites was composed of smaller particles with lower organic matter content that were richer in nitrogen and autotrophic material. Areal respiration and nutrient uptake rates increased 11- to 67-fold with stream size. While microbial activity rates did not increase with stream size, benthic POM-associated microbial biomass increased 20-fold with stream size, and closely tracked a 15-fold increase in light availability, and primary production. Thus, microbial biomass, not activity, determined longitudinal patterns in benthic POM-associated areal nutrient uptake and respiration rates.

This study characterizes hydrologic dynamics of 15 catchments of the U.S. Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network where we hypothesized that our understanding of subsurface structure would illuminate patterns of hydrologic partitioning. The CZOs collect data sets that characterize the physical, chemical, and biological architecture of the subsurface, while also monitoring hydrologic fluxes such as streamflow, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. For the first time, we collate time series of hydrologic variables across the CZO network and begin the process of examining hydrologic signatures across sites. We find that catchments with low baseflow indices and high runoff sensitivity to storage receive most of their precipitation as rain and contain clay-rich regolith profiles, prominent argillic horizons, and/or anthropogenic modifications. In contrast, sites with high baseflow indices and low runoff sensitivity to storage receive the majority of precipitation as snow and have more permeable regolith profiles. The seasonal variability of water balance components is a key control on the dynamic range of hydraulically connected water in the critical zone.

Dana; Dralle, David",Resilience of woody ecosystems to precipitation variability,,,,,http://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/3356/,"Large-scale plant mortality has far-reaching consequences for the water and carbon cycles. The role of belowground root-zone water storage (RWS) on the conditions that lead to mortality remains uncertain. It has been proposed that the RWS capacity, Smax, can determine ecosystem vulnerability to drought (Hahm et al., 2019a, Klos et al., 2018). However, incorporating information about RWS into prediction of vegetation dynamics has been limited due to the challenge of quantifying RWS at large scales (Dawson et al., 2020, Trugman et al., 2021). Here, we present a mass-balance framework for assessing forest resilience to year-to-year variability in precipitation, including megadroughts, by quantifying RWS. We use the relationship between RWS and annual precipitation to evaluate the sensitivity of woody ecosystems to precipitation variability by classifying them as either capacity limited, where RWS is nearly constant annually and set by Smax, or precipitation limited, where RWS varies annually based on precipitation amount. We applied this framework to seasonally dry forests and savannas in California and found that approximately 16-23% of the state's total biomass is found in precipitation-limited locations where plants commonly rely on carryover of moisture from one year to the next. These precipitation-limited areas experienced disproportionately high rates of mortality in recent drought. In contrast, approximately 51-58% of the state's biomass is found in capacity-limited locations and thus experiences annually reliable moisture supply. Using precipitation projections for the next century, the model framework reveals a tipping point by which 5,163 km2 (27 Tg aboveground carbon) of forest and savanna could transition from stable to unstable moisture supply. An additional 11,950 km2 (55 Tg aboveground carbon) where moisture supply is already annually unstable is projected to experience increased water stress, due to additional years where precipitation is not sufficient to refill moisture deficits generated in dry years. This framework provides a novel approach for assessing vulnerability of RWS, and thus woody ecosystems, to climate change.",5/22/2022,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,9/20/2022 2:59,,,,,,,,,,,,Hydrology,,,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.31223/X5XW7D,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet in vast literature on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus), the seasonal interaction between habitat conditions and food availability has received relatively little attention. We examined juvenile O. mykiss rearing, physical habitat, and resource phenologies in two Mediterranean coastal streams – one perennial, cool, and shaded; the other intermittent, seasonally warm, and sunny. We used a bioenergetics model to investigate the timing and magnitude of growth potential for drift foraging O. mykiss during the spring and summer in both systems. Growth potential peaked at least two months earlier in the intermittent stream than in the perennial stream. By early summer (June), growth potential had declined in the intermittent stream, whereas growth rates were peaking in the perennial stream. However, the mid-July lipid content of juvenile O. mykiss in the intermittent stream was nearly twice that of fish in the perennial stream. By late summer (August), foraging profitability declined in both streams, as abiotic conditions in the intermittent stream approached lethal. In contrast, the perennial stream maintained suitable abiotic conditions even though growth rate was low. We suggest that the divergent resource phenologies and seasonal mortality risks experienced by anadromous O. mykiss rearing in these streams could drive diversification of traits governing size, age, and timing of outmigration.",2022,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,9/20/2022 3:01,,,,,,,,,,,,Dryad,,en,Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,DOI: 10.6078/D1TM66,,,,,FOS: Natural sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These communities serve to oxidize dissolved sulfides to sulfate, and are typically associated with the recent exposure of sulfide-rich sediments. Such mats are also ubiquitous in areas of hydrocarbon seepage, where they are thought to consume sulfide generated in underlying sediment. Despite the high abundance of dissolved methane in hydrocarbon seeps, few studies have considered the importance of methanotrophy in mat communities. To assess the importance of methanotrophs in microbial mats from hydrocarbon seeps, an approach involving lipid biomarkers, stable isotopes and enrichment culturing was applied. Microbial mat samples were collected from benthic surfaces at two hydrocarbon seeps located in the Coal Oil Point seep field, offshore from Goleta, California. Both samples display a high abundance of 16:1 fatty acids, including two isomers specific to type I methanotrophic bacteria, 16:1(ω8) and 16:1(ω6). Depleted values of δ13C found in 16:1 fatty acids suggests methane assimilation into biomass, whereas three separate investigations of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria yield fractionation factors too small to account for these values. On the basis of these observations and experiments, an isotope mass balance was applied to fatty acids present in the microbial mat samples which indicates methanotrophs contribute up to 46% of total fatty acids. These results implicate methanotrophy as an important function for microbial mats in seep areas, despite the visual appearance of these mats as being composed of giant sulfur bacteria.",3/1/2008,11/18/2020 21:53,2020-11-18T21:53:32Z,3/31/2014 7:51,G01015,,G1,113,,J.

For example, a previous study of the California vole (Microtus californicus) showed morphological divergence between populations in northern and southern California and decreased fertility in crosses between the populations. To investigate phylogeo-graphic differences in this species, we assessed variation in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA throughout much of its distribution from Oregon to Baja California. We generated molecular data (mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear acid phosphatase V intron [AP5]) for 178 individuals. Examination of these data suggests 2 phylogeographic groups that are largely discordant with the boundaries of 17 currently recognized subspecies. Estimates of pairwise genetic divergence between these groups for cytochrome b are as high as 4.46% uncorrected p. Sequence data for AP5 also indicate a division between populations of M. californicus in northern and southern California. Examination of data from the mitochondrial and nuclear markers together suggests limited gene flow between clades. These data are concordant with other studies that suggest that mountain ranges in California were important in within- and possibly between-species divergence and subsequent contact.

In this study, we examined the spatial patterns of methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in the dominant groups of aquatic insect larvae across a network of streams (drainage area ranging from 0.5 to 150 km2) in northern California during summer baseflow conditions. We found that, with the exception of water striders, all invertebrate groups showed significant (p < 0.05) increases in MeHg concentrations with drainage area. The largest stream in our study watershed, the South Fork Eel River, had the highest aqueous MeHg concentration (unfiltered: 0.13−0.17 ng L−1) while most of the upstream tributaries had aqueous MeHg concentrations close to or below the established detection limits (0.02 ng L−1). A filamentous alga abundant in South Fork Eel River (Cladophora glomerata) had an exceptionally high fraction of total-Hg as MeHg (i.e., %MeHg from 50−100%). Since other potential hotspots of in-stream Hg methylation (e.g., surface sediment and deep pools) had %MeHg lower than or similar to surface water (∼14%), we hypothesize that Cladophora and possibly other autotrophs may serve as hotspots of in-stream MeHg production in this bedrock-dominated stream. Recent studies in other regions concluded that wetland abundance in the watershed is the predominant factor in governing Hg concentrations of stream biota. However, our results show that, in the absence of wetlands, substantial spatial variation of Hg bioaccumulation can arise in stream networks due to the influence of in-stream processes.",9/15/2009,1/31/2020 22:02,2020-01-31T22:02:13Z,12/3/2016 3:29,7016-7022,,18,43,,Environ.

Multiple functions, including protection from predators, resistance to entrainment by high flows, and improved respiration, have been suggested for caddisfly cases. We investigated the functional role of cases built by Dicosmoecus gilvipes, a limnephilid caddisfly. In this species, the 1st- through 4th-instar larvae build cases with plant material and attach Douglas-fir needles as lateral extensions that resemble vanes on an arrow. We tested whether the lateral extensions and entire case deterred predators by manipulating lateral extensions and case presence for larvae exposed to large steelhead trout. No larva with a case (with or without lateral extensions) was consumed during the experiment, whereas all larvae without a case were consumed. We tested whether lateral extensions provided stability against overturning and entrainment by manipulating presence of lateral extensions and subjecting larvae to turbulent flow conditions. Once dislodged, larvae with lateral extensions experienced fewer revolutions and regained their footing faster than those without extensions. Our results suggest lateral extensions provide stability against overturning in fast flow and may improve the ability of larvae to forage efficiently in turbulent flow conditions.

Changes in seasonal water availability had pronounced effects on individual species, but as precipitation regimes were sustained across years, feedbacks and species interactions overrode autecological responses to water and reversed community trajectories. Conditions that sharply increased production and diversity through 2 years caused simplification of the food web and deep reductions in consumer abundance after 5 years.

In streams, species effects on resources and community structure may change as physical characteristics of the stream environment change along drainage networks. We examined spatial and seasonal effects of armored grazers using a small-scale exclusion experiment that was replicated in streams of different drainage areas. Effects of grazing varied with stream size and were related to variation in grazer abundance and phenology. We identified three distinct grazing regimes and a stream size (drainage area [DA]) threshold corresponding to a shift from one to two functional trophic levels. In streams with DA < 1 km2, armored grazers did not reduce biomass of algal biofilms. In slightly larger streams (2–3 km2 DA), the armored grazer guild was dominated by bivoltine Glossosoma. These caddisflies persisted and limited algal biofilms throughout the summer in one of these streams. In the largest tributaries (DA > 10 km2), the grazer guild was dominated by univoltine caddisflies, and grazing limited algal biofilms in early summer, but not late summer, after caddisflies pupated.

In this Mediterranean climate, rainy winters precede the biologically active summer low-flow season. Cladophora glomerata, the filamentous green alga that dominates primary producer biomass during summer, reaches peak biomass during late spring or early summer. Cladophora blooms are larger if floods during the preceding winter attained or exceeded “bankfull discharge” (sufficient to mobilize much of the river bed, estimated at 120 m3/s). In 9 out of 12 summers preceded by large bed-scouring floods, the average peak height of attached Cladophora turfs equaled or exceeded 50 cm. In five out of six years when flows remained below bankfull, Cladophora biomass peaked at lower levels. Flood effects on algae were partially mediated through impacts on consumers in food webs. In three experiments that followed scouring winter floods, juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and roach (Lavinia (Hesperoleucas) symmetricus) suppressed certain insects and young-of-the-year fish fry, affecting persistence or accrual of algae positively or negatively, depending on the predator-specific vulnerabilities of primary consumers capable of suppressing algae during a given year. During two post-flood years, these grazers were more vulnerable to small predators (odonates and fish fry, which stocked steelhead always suppressed) than to experimentally manipulated, larger fish, which had adverse effects on algae in those years. During one post-flood year, all enclosed grazers capable of suppressing algae were consumed by steelhead, which therefore had positive effects on algae. During drought years, when no bed-scouring winter flows occurred, large armored caddisflies (Dicosmoecus gilvipes) were more abundant during the subsequent summer. In drought-year experiments, stocked fish had little or no influence on algal standing crops, which increased only when Dicosmoecus were removed from enclosures. Flood scour, by suppressing invulnerable grazers, set the stage for fish mediated effects on algae in this river food web. Whether these effects were positive or negative depended on the predator-specific vulnerabilities of primary consumers that dominated during a given summer.",5/1/2008,1/31/2020 22:02,2020-01-31T22:02:00Z,1/19/2013 7:49,263-282,,2,78,,Ecological Monographs,SEASONAL REASSEMBLY OF A RIVER FOOD WEB,,,,,,,,,,,,ESA Journals,,,,,,Cladophora glomerata; Lavinia (Hesperoleucas) symmetricus; Mediterranean hydrologic regimes; Oncorhynchus mykiss; algal blooms; context dependency; effect sizes; flood scour; food chain length; interaction strength; long-term studies; predator impacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored a method for developing a scaling relationship between macroinvertebrate density and local hydraulic variables. As an example of this method, we quantified habitat for larval stone-cased caddisflies, Glossosoma califica and Glossosoma penitum, in 3 coastal mountain streams in northern California over 2 y. We applied dimensional analysis to develop a functional relationship from a power law based on dimensionless local hydraulic and larval density variables that was applicable to areas where Glossosoma are present. Glossosoma densities were negatively correlated with streambed relative roughness and positively correlated with the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces in the stream. The proposed functional relationship described 41% of the variance in the spatial distribution of glossosomatid larvae. This expression could predict how density and constraints on effects of these important grazers would change under variable hydraulic conditions. Variogram analysis of Glossosoma spatial density and relative roughness revealed overlap in the variogram range, the separation distance above which point measurements were statistically independent. The analysis resulted in an average variogram range of 0.39 m for Glossosoma density and 0.26 m for roughness height. Abiotic variables are increasingly available from laser altimetry, so even where field sampling is limited the proposed scaling relationship facilitates prediction of larval biomass over a range of scales in lotic ecosystems.",3/29/2011,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:59Z,3/31/2014 6:00,493-506,,2,30,,Journal of the North American Benthological Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,BioOne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indirect effects of subsidies may be either positive or negative depending on the behavior of the shared consumer. Here we document strong links between riverine insects, riparian lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), and terrestrial invertebrates. We hypothesized that aquatic insects subsidize riparian lizard populations leading to higher growth rates of these lizards in near-river habitats, and that subsidies exert short-term positive effects on terrestrial resources as a result of diet shifts by lizards to aquatic insects. To test these hypotheses, we used 2 m high fences, or “subsidy shields,” to experimentally reduce aquatic insect flux to large (91 m2) enclosures of lizards. Subsidy shields reduced aquatic insect flux by 55–65%. Growth rates of lizards were 7× higher in subsidized (no-shield) enclosures during the early summer but were not significantly different later in the summer, when ambient fluxes of aquatic insects dropped to 20% of their early season levels. Within the watershed, lizard growth rates (in mass) were positively correlated with the numerical abundance of aquatic insects. Thus, lizard growth rates tracked both seasonal and spatial availability of riverine insect subsidies during our experiment. Subsidies also had indirect effects on the ground-dwelling, terrestrial prey of lizards. Declines of diurnal terrestrial invertebrates were significantly higher in shield than no-shield enclosures, and the most common ground spider (Arctosa sp. [Lycosidae]) disappeared completely from shield enclosures by the end of the experiment. Declines in terrestrial invertebrate abundance did not differ between no-shield enclosures and lizard exclosures. These data suggest that riverine insects subsidize riparian Sceloporus and, in the short term, reduce their predation on terrestrial arthropods.",7/1/2002,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:58Z,1/19/2013 8:49,1860-1869,,7,83,,Ecology,RIVER–WATERSHED EXCHANGE,,,,,,,,,,,,ESA Journals,,,,,,Arctosa sp; Sceloporus occidentalis; functional response; ground spider; lizard; predation; riparian; river; river–watershed exchange; subsidy; watershed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soil fungi are known to increase plant-available phosphorus by promoting dissolution of various phosphate minerals. Yet no apatite dissolution studies exist using fungi as weathering agents, and regulation of fungal weathering activity in response to different levels of phosphorus availability is largely unknown.Fungi were isolated from a grassland soil in northern California. Three pathways of tri-calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2) (TCP) dissolution in liquid culture were identified among biogeochemically active fungi: (1) acidification (pH 3.3 ± 0.16), (2) moderate acidification (pH 4.9 ± 0.11) and (3) no acidification. Isolates representing pathway 1 and 2 were Zygomycetes in the order of Mucorales. All non-acidifying isolates in pathway 3 were Ascomycetes and cleared the media by altering TCP into hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) and sequestering it within mycelial spheres. One isolate representing each pathway was used in fluorapatite dissolution experiments either with the fungi present or under abiotic conditions using cell-free liquid media conditioned by fungal growth at different phosphorus and calcium availabilities.Both Mucorales isolates acidify their substrate when growing in the presence of phosphorus. Mucorales exudates were mainly oxalic acid, and conditioned cell-free media with phosphorus induced fluorapatite dissolution at a rate of 10−0.9±0.14 and 10−1.2±0.22 µmol P m−2 s−1. The ascomycete isolate on the other hand, induced fluorapatite dissolution at a rate of 10−1.1±0.05 µmol P m−2 s−1 by lowering the pH of the media under phosphorus-limited conditions, without producing significant amounts of low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs). Oxalate strongly etches fluorapatite along channels parallel to [001], forming needle-like features, while exudates from the ascomycete-induced surface rounding. We conclude that while LMWOAs are well-studied weathering agents, these do not appear to be produced by fungi in response to phosphorus-limiting growth conditions.",2007,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:51Z,1/19/2013 7:29,265-280,,3,5,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, subsidies may have indirect effects on the in situ prey of these consumers. These indirect effects can be either negative (e.g., apparent competition) or positive (e.g., via diet shifts) depending on the relative strength of the predator's functional and numerical responses to prey subsidies. Here we report a numerical response by a lizard (Western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis) to experimental reductions in the flux of river-derived insects. Initially, equal densities of lizards declined significantly faster in plots in which aquatic insect abundance was reduced by nearly 50% (season average) relative to controls. Abundance and biomass of terrestrial arthropods declined significantly between the start and end of the experiment across treatments. Despite consistently lower lizard abundance in plots with reduced subsidy levels, however, relative declines in the abundance and biomass of in situ terrestrial arthropods (all taxa combined) were not significantly different between reduced- and ambient-subsidy plots. Relative declines in spider biomass differed significantly between treatments and were higher in reduced-subsidy than ambient-subsidy plots, but only over one of three 3-wk sampling intervals. Thus, over the biologically active summer season, aquatic subsidies exerted brief positive or no significant indirect effects on the in situ prey of riparian lizards. These results suggest that, although aquatic insect prey may determine the spatial distribution and local abundance of riparian predators, the effects of increased predator density on in situ prey may be offset by higher per capita predation by these consumers on in situ prey in subsidy-poor relative to subsidy-rich habitats.",11/1/2002,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:49Z,1/19/2013 8:50,3023-3036,,11,83,,Ecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,ESA Journals,,,,,,Carabidae; Food web; Lycosidae; Sceloporus occidentalis; Western fence lizard; indirect effects; insect; lizard; numerical response; riparian; river–watershed exchange; subsidy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small streams (0.1–10 km2 watershed area) had longitudinally similar nutrient concentration and composition with low (2) dissolved nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratios.

Wetlands are widely recognized as hotspots for the production of methylmercury and are often assumed to be the main sources of this neurotoxin in downstream ecosystems. However, many streams lacking wetlands in their drainage basins (e.g., montane and semiarid regions in the western United States) have significant methylmercury contamination, and the sources of methylmercury in these streams remain largely unknown. In this study, we observed substantial production of methylmercury within a highly productive stream channel in northern California (South Fork Eel River) within a drainage basin lacking wetlands. We found that in situ methylmercury production is positively related to phosphorus removal and water temperature within the stream channel, supporting hypothesized biological mediation of in situ mercury transformation. Moreover, our data suggest that epiphytic microbial communities on a dominant filamentous alga (Cladophora glomerata) could play a role in in situ methylmercury production. Because peak in situ methylmercury production coincides with the period of the highest biological productivity during summer baseflow, methylmercury produced internally may be efficiently routed into local stream food webs. Our study provides strong evidence that stream channels, especially those associated with high primary productivity, can be important for regulating the bioavailability and toxicity of this global contaminant.",9/15/2010,1/31/2020 22:01,2020-01-31T22:01:43Z,3/31/2014 5:54,6998-7004,,18,44,,Environ.

3YT73ZX5,thesis,2014,"Kim, Hyojin",Water chemistry evolution through the critical zone,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/636753xc,"Water as it passes through the critical zone - from top of the trees to the bottom of the groundwater table - plays a critical role in chemical weathering of rocks and in the global carbon cycle. Although the chemistry of surface water (i.e. rivers and lakes) has been intensively monitored at high-frequency (&lt;1 day), the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater chemistry in the critical zone, especially in the weathered bedrock zone, has been rarely observed. In many catchments located at temperate regions, nearly all rainwater infiltrates into subsurface, thus identifying the processes and environmental controls for the groundwater chemistry will be fundamental to understand the stream chemistry dynamics. Here, this dissertation directly monitored the groundwater chemistry flowing through a thick weathered argillite zone (5- 25m), underlain by a thin soil layer (&lt;0.75m) in a hillslope in the Elder Creek catchment, located at Angelo Coast Range Reserve, Northern California. Groundwater samples from three locations along the hillslope (i.e. upslope, midslope and downslope) and the creek samples from adjacent Elder Creek were collected at 1-3 days frequency from late 2008 to early 2013 using a novel autonomous sampling methodology developed for this study. This study site has been intensively monitored (5- 30 minute frequency) for microclimate, groundwater table/ temperature, soil moisture/ temperature, and tree sap flows since 2008. Observations of the dynamics of major cations (Na, Mg, K, and Ca), Si, and reactive trace metals, led to the identification of three key governing processes, each occurring at specific locations within the critical zone, that are responsible for water chemistry evolution in the critical zone. During the rainy season, rain water and throughfall - rainwater that has penetrated through tree canopy - as it passes through the vadoze zone, rapidly gains major cations through via cation exchange reactions enhanced by elevated subsurface pCO2. At the same time, rainwater increases its Si concentration through dissolution of amorphous silica phases. This new water recharges the groundwater and in upslope and midslope wells, raising their groundwater table by 4-6 m. During this high flow regime, the connectivity between the groundwater and stream increases significantly. Therefore, this groundwater rapidly flows into the stream and the groundwater and stream display the similar chemistry (fast-flowing groundwater). During the dry season, the groundwater table and the stream discharge recede to their lowest levels and the cation concentrations of the groundwater become higher but its Si concentration decreases. During this season, the chemistry of groundwater is governed by thermodynamic equilibrium with the argillite at high pCO2 (slow-flowing groundwater). The groundwater may become fully equilibrated with reactive minerals such as calcite and clay minerals but may be far from equilibrium with primary minerals (e.g. albite). Silicon in the groundwater may form secondary minerals, decreasing its concentration. When this equilibrated groundwater enters the stream, its chemistry will be dramatically altered via degassing of CO2 leading to abiotic and biotic carbonate mineral precipitation at the hillslope-stream interface. The biotic calcite precipitation appears to increase the partitioning of Mg in calcite, decreasing the groundwater's Mg concentration by 30%. This fundamental hydrochemistry process framework explains the dynamics of reactive species, such as Fe and Mn. The Mn concentrations in the subsurface paralleled the behavior of major cations but varied by as much as 3 orders of magnitude vs. factors of 2 to 5 for major cations; the groundwater's Mn concentration rapidly decreased as the groundwater table rises and vice versa. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Mn is mostly in dissolved form, and like major cations and that the controlling processes for major cations govern the Mn's behavior. However, even during the high flow regime, Mn in the fast-flowing groundwater is precipitated when it enters the stream, likely via Mn-oxide precipitation at the hillslope-stream interface. In contrast, Fe displayed no systematic correlation with the groundwater table dynamics or stream discharge. The highest Fe concentrations in both groundwater and stream were expressed at the beginning of the rainy season. In addition, the Fe concentration in the groundwater and stream display quite similar values. This suggests that Fe may be in colloidal form, likely organic-ligand bound. This organic ligand Fe- colloid may be more stable and less bio-available that dissolved elements; hence, Fe precipitation at the hillslope-stream interface may be negligible. This dissertation demonstrated that the slow-flowing groundwater transported through the deepest weathered bedrock zone plays a significant role in fluxes of solute and solid to the adjacent creek. The atmospheric inputs of major cations and Si were insignificant compared with the Elder Creek' solute fluxes while that of Mn was 1 -2 orders of magnitude higher than in Elder Creek's solute fluxes; rain and throughfall data for Fe are unreliable. The first process in the vadose zone is responsible for 55% (12 t/km2/year) of the annual cation fluxes. The slow-flowing component is responsible for the rest of 45% annual cation fluxes (9.4 t/km2/year). The third process - water chemistry transition at the hillslope-stream interface - will precipitate 29 t/km2/year of Ca + Mg (mostly as calcite) from the slow-flowing groundwater. This process is also responsible for precipitating approximately 0.2 t/km2/year of Mn and 0.02 t/km2/year of Fe, which are greater than their atmospheric inputs. These findings demonstrate that the loss by carbonate precipitation at the transition zone 1) is greater than the dissolved cation fluxes estimated based on the Elder Creek chemistry observations (21.4 t/km2/year); and 2) Fe and Mn are not accumulating in the system, unlike previously considered. The significant solute precipitation at the hillslope-stream interface suggests that the role of chemical weathering of rock may play a much greater role in sequestrating CO2 than the previously quantified. In addition, a large pool of chemical weathering solid fluxes has not been taken into account properly in the global element budgets.",2014,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/18/2022 19:27,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Berkeley,,en,,,,,escholarship.org,,,,,,ERCZO; critical zone; water chemistry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, plant and ecosystem scientists turned their attention using d-excess information to inform questions at these scales. Here, we use the d-excess parameter to evaluate the influence of forest canopies on atmospheric humidity within a mixed evergreen forest in coastal California. We found that during the day, when transpiration was at a maximum, the d-excess of atmospheric water vapour exceeded model predictions for the background atmosphere into which the ecosystem evapotranspiration mixes. At night when transpiration was minor, the d-excess of atmospheric water vapour was on average less than model predictions for an ocean derived water vapour source. The observed diurnal fluctuations around the d-excess of the modelled background water vapour provided a strong evidence that during the day as the land surface warms and the boundary layer grows plants alter the isotope composition of atmospheric humidity via non-steady state isotope effects. In contrast, at night equilibrium isotope effects dominate as the atmosphere stabilizes. These day and nighttime fluctuations around the d-excess of ocean derived water vapour highlight the importance of plant transpiration for the isotope hydrology of near surface humidity and subsequently for the isotope composition of condensate like dew, an important water input to this ecosystem.

Concentrations of MeHg in organisms are highly variable, and the sources in natural food webs are often not well understood. This study examined stable isotope ratios of MeHg (mass-dependent fractionation, as δ202HgMeHg; and mass-independent fractionation, as Δ199HgMeHg) in benthic invertebrates, juvenile steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and water striders (Gerris remigis) along a stream productivity gradient, as well as carnivorous terrestrial invertebrates, in a forested watershed at the headwater of South Fork Eel River in northern California. Throughout the sampling sites, δ202HgMeHg (after correction due to the effect of MeHg photodegradation) was significantly different between benthic (median = −1.40‰; range, −2.34 to −0.78‰; total number of samples = 29) and terrestrial invertebrates (median = +0.51‰; range, −0.37 to +1.40‰; total number of samples = 9), but no major difference between these two groups was found for Δ199HgMeHg. Steelhead trout (52 individual fishes) have MeHg of predominantly aquatic origins, with a few exceptions at the upstream locations (e.g., 1 fish collected in a tributary had a purely terrestrial MeHg source and 4 fishes had mixed aquatic and terrestrial MeHg sources). Water striders (seven pooled samples) derive MeHg largely from terrestrial sources throughout headwater sections. These data suggest that direct terrestrial subsidy (e.g., terrestrial invertebrates falling into water) can be important for some stream predators in headwater streams and could represent an important means of transfer of terrestrially derived MeHg (e.g., in situ methylation within forests, atmospheric sources) to aquatic ecosystems. Moreover, these findings show that terrestrial subsidies can enhance MeHg bioaccumulation of consumers in headwater streams where aqueous MeHg levels are very low.",9/2/2014,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/18/2022 16:20,10128-10135,,17,48,,Environ.

We discuss how critical threshold changes in summer discharge can potentially tilt the Eel from a recovering salmon-supporting ecosystem toward a cyanobacterially degraded one. To maintain food webs and habitats that support salmonids and suppress harmful cyanobacteria, summer discharge must be sufficient to connect mainstem pools hydrologically with gently moving, cool base flow. Rearing salmon and steelhead can survive even in pools that become isolated during summer low flows if hyporheic exchange is sufficient. But if the ground water discharge that sustains river flow during summer drought drops below critical levels, warm stagnant conditions will kill salmonids, and cyanobacteria will thrive. Challenges and opportunities for restoring the Eel and increasing its resilience to climate extremes, water diversions, and excessive loading of fine sediments point toward exploring how land use and terrestrial vegetation affect delivery from uplands of water, heat, sediments, solutes, organic matter, and organisms—in ways that either heal or damage rivers.",2015-03,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/17/2022 18:09,200-211,,1,2015,,cope,The Thirsty Eel,,,,,,,,,,,,bioone.org,,Publisher: The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists,,,,ERCZO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a new parameterization of hydraulic conductivity that captures the preferential flow and is easy to implement in global climate models. To mimic the naturally varying heterogeneity with depth in the subsurface, the model represents the hydraulic conductivity as a product of the effective saturation and a background hydraulic conductivity Kbkg, drawn from a lognormal distribution. The mean of the background Kbkg decreases monotonically with depth, while its variance reduces with the effective saturation. Model parameters are derived by assimilating into Richards’ equation 6 years of 30 min observations of precipitation (mm) and water table depths (m), from seven wells along a steep hillslope in the Eel River watershed in Northern California. The results show that the observed rapid penetration of precipitation and the fast rise of the water table from the well locations, after the first winter rains, are well captured with the new stochastic approach in contrast to the standard van Genuchten model of hydraulic conductivity, which requires significantly higher levels of saturated soils to produce the same results. “Rock moisture,” the moisture between the soil mantle and the water table, comprises 30% of the moisture because of the great depth of the weathered bedrock layer and could be a potential source of moisture to sustain trees through extended dry periods. Furthermore, storage of moisture in the soil mantle is smaller, implying less surface runoff and less evaporation, with the proposed new model.",2015,2/7/2024 6:49,2024-02-07T06:49:21Z,2/17/2022 18:15,2105-2135,,4,7,,,Toward a new parameterization of hydraulic conductivity in climate models,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015MS000516,,,,ERCZO; Richards’ equation; climate models; preferential flow; rapid water table fluctuations; stochastic hydraulic conductivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The critical zone extends from the top of the vegetation canopy through the soil and down to fresh bedrock and the bottom of the groundwater. Only recently recognized as a distinct zone, it is challenging to study because it is hard to observe directly, and varies widely across biogeoclimatic regions. Yet new ideas, instruments, and observations are revealing surprising and sometimes paradoxical insights, underscoring the value of field campaigns and long-term observatories. These insights bear directly on some of the most pressing societal problems today: maintaining healthy forests, sustaining streamflow during droughts, and restoring productive terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The critical zone is critical because it supports all terrestrial life; it is the nexus where water and carbon is cycled, vegetation (hence food) grows, soil develops, landscapes evolve, and we live.

Despite such obvious importance, rates at which these terrestrial waterrock reactions occur remain difficult to constrain. Two factors that create this limitation are the difficulty in making direct observations across the vadose zone (VZ), where chemical weathering rates are often highest, and the complexity of biogeochemical processes and transport pathways that lead to solute generation in catchments. Here, we take advantage of a novel Vadose Zone Monitoring System installed in an acively eroding, shaledominated hillslope within the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory to characterize the development of solute chemistry at the inception of rock weathering. We resolve silicate weathering in the VZ and the transferral of solutes to groundwater and streams using dissolved concentrations and isotopes of lithium (Li). The evolution of these Li signatures across the hillslope resembles a boomerang-like pattern typified by depleted VZ water ([Li] = 0.3 μM & d7 Li = -9 ‰), concentrated groundwater ([Li] = 2.8 μM & d7 Li = 17 ‰), and isotopically heavy riverine ([Li] = 0.1 μM & d7 Li = 29 ‰) end-members. Integration of these data into an isotope-enabled, multicomponent, 1-D reactive transport model shows: (1) the dynamic balance between dissolution of pre-existing minerals and precipitation of new secondary phases is a first-order control on solute generation in the VZ (2) secondary clay formation requires a shift from kaoliniteto illite-dominant precipitation with depth; (3) weathering processes that fractionate lithium continue beyond the VZ and into the saturated zone as groundwater migrates laterally downslope and is subject to mixing and dilution.",2020,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,Goldschmidt 2020 Virtual Conference,,,,,,,,,,,,,ERCZO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We quantified use of two tributary confluence plumes by juvenile steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss, throughout the summer, including how trout positioned themselves in relation to temperature within confluence plumes. At two confluences, Cedar and Elder creeks, along the South Fork Eel River, California, USA, we monitored temperatures using in situ logger grids throughout summer 2016. Fish were counted within confluences via snorkel surveys five times a day on 5 days at each site. We found diel and seasonal dependence on confluence use by steelhead, especially at the Cedar Creek confluence, where mainstem temperatures exceeded 28°C. At this site, fish moved into the confluence on the warmest days and warmest times of the day. Fish observed within the Cedar Creek confluence plume were most common in locations between 20–22°C, rather than the coldest locations (14.5°C). At Elder Creek, where mainstem temperatures remained below 24°C, there was little relationship between mainstem temperature and steelhead presence in the confluence plume. At both sites, steelhead distribution within plumes was influenced by spatial variation of temperature and mean temperature in surveyed grid cells. Our results show that cool tributaries flowing into warmer mainstem reaches (over 24°C) likely create important thermal refuges for juvenile steelhead. As mainstem rivers warm with climate change, cool-water tributary inputs may become more important for sustaining cold-water salmonids near the southern end of their range.",2020,2/7/2024 6:42,2024-02-07T06:42:16Z,2/15/2022 19:04,1076-1086,,7,36,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rra.3634,,,,ERCZO,Eel River; Oncorhynchus mykiss; climate change; microhabitat; stream temperatures; thermal refuges; thermal tolerance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present a lower-bound estimate of the contribution of bedrock water storage to transpiration across the continental United States using distributed, publicly available datasets. Temporal and spatial patterns of bedrock water use across the continental United States indicate that woody plants extensively access bedrock water for transpiration. Plants across diverse climates and biomes access bedrock water routinely and not just during extreme drought conditions. On an annual basis in California, the volumes of bedrock water transpiration exceed the volumes of water stored in human-made reservoirs, and woody vegetation that accesses bedrock water accounts for over 50% of the aboveground carbon stocks in the state.

Use of the natural ratios of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes as tracers of trophic interactions has some clear advantages over alternative methods for food web analyses, yet is limited to situations where organic materials of interest have adequate isotopic separation between potential sources. This constrains the use of natural abundance stable isotope approaches to a subset of ecosystems with biogeochemical conditions favourable to source separation. 2. Recent studies suggest that stable hydrogen isotopes (δD) could provide a robust tracer to distinguish contributions of aquatic and terrestrial production in food webs, but variation in δD of consumers and their organic food sources are poorly known. To explore the utility of the stable hydrogen isotope approach, we examined variation in δD in stream food webs in a forested catchment where variation in δ13C has been described previously. 3. Although algal δD varied by taxa and, to a small degree, between sites, we found consistent and clear separation (by an average of 67‰) from terrestrial carbon sources. Environmental conditions known to affect algal δ13C, such as water velocity and stream productivity did not greatly influence algal δD, and there was no evidence of seasonal variation. In contrast, algal δ13C was strongly affected by environmental factors both within and across sites, was seasonally variable at all sites, and partially overlapped with terrestrial δ13C in all streams with catchment areas larger than 10 km2. 4. While knowledge of isotopic exchange with water and trophic fractionation of δD for aquatic consumers is limited, consistent source separation in streams suggests that δD may provide a complementary food web tracer to δ13C in aquatic food webs. Lack of significant seasonal or spatial variation in δD is a distinct advantage over δ13C for applications in many aquatic ecosystems.",5/1/2010,1/31/2020 22:02,2020-01-31T22:02:15Z,12/3/2016 3:28,941-951,,5,55,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,energy flow; food webs; stable isotopes; subsidies; trophic interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use spiralling metrics to examine how the coupling of nitrogen and phosphorus uptake varies between streams dominated by either heterotrophic (i.e. bacteria-dominated) or autotrophic (algal-dominated) microbial communities. 2. Algae generally exhibit greater capacity to store nutrients than bacteria because of differences in cellular structures. These differences led us to hypothesise that the uptake of N and P in heterotrophic ecosystems should have reduced stoichiometric variation in response to changes in supply N : P compared to autotrophic ecosystems when assimilation dominates nutrient uptake. 3. To test this hypothesis, we used an array of serial nutrient additions in several streams in the South Fork Eel River watershed in Northern California. In one set of experiments, N and P were added alone and simultaneously in separate experiments to two small, heterotrophic streams to assess uptake rates and interactions between nutrient cycles. In a second set of experiments, N and P were added simultaneously at a range of N : P in one heterotrophic and one autotrophic stream to assess differences in uptake responses to changes in supply N : P. 4. Results of these experiments suggest two important conclusions. First, increased N supply significantly shortened P uptake lengths, while P addition had little impact on N uptake in both streams, indicating that uptake of non-limiting nutrients is tightly coupled to the availability of the limiting element. Second, changes in P uptake and uptake ratios (UN : UP) with increased supply N : P supported our hypothesis that heterotrophic streams are more homeostatic in their responses to changes in nutrient supply than autotrophic streams, suggesting that physiological controls on nutrient use scale up to influence ecosystem-scale patterns in nutrient cycling.",3/1/2011,1/31/2020 22:02,2020-01-31T22:02:09Z,3/31/2014 6:31,424-436,,3,56,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,Stoichiometry; autotrophic; ecosystem homeostasis; heterotrophic; nutrient spiralling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Focus on tadpole diet and foraging behavior offers potential for integrating ecological and endocrinological approaches to understanding anuran metamorphosis. Natural larval diets vary widely in relative amounts of protein, carbohydrate and lipid, factors known to influence thyroid hormone function, which in turn is essential for metamorphosis to occur. Previous work has shown that tadpoles fed high protein diets grow and develop quickly. This pattern is consistent with findings from other classes of vertebrates that some aspects of thyroid function, e.g., activity of 5′D monodeiodinase, an enzyme that converts thyroxine (T4) to the more potent metamorphosis-inducer 3,5,3′- triiodothyronine (T3), are proportional to availability of dietary protein. In field experiments at a northern California river, I found that nutritional variation among algal taxa routinely consumed by tadpoles (chlorophytes, diatoms, cyanobacteria, etc.) influenced metamorphosis several ways. Growth rate was positively correlated with percent protein content of a food type. Tadpoles fed filamentous green algae with epiphytic diatoms developed more quickly and metamorphosed at larger sizes than tadpoles raised on other diets. The dominant diatoms in this system are high in protein because they host nitrogen fixing cyanobacterial endosymbionts. Resource quality also mediated the effects of competition and predation. Changes in abundance of high quality algae caused by invading bullfrog (R. catesbeiana) tadpoles explained most of their competitive effects on metamorphosis of native tadpoles (Hyla regilla and (Rana boylii). In choice experiments, tadpoles foraged selectively on the algal foods that promoted most rapid growth and development. In the presence of garter snake predators, however, tadpoles avoided such patches thus decreasing growth. Direct examination of thyroid hormone production in tadpoles consuming different diets may reveal a proximate mechanism linking diet quality to size at and time to metamorphosis.",4/1/1997,1/31/2020 22:02,2020-01-31T22:02:08Z,3/31/2014 6:30,146-159,,2,37,,Amer.

Radioisotope techniques, including the dual-label method, were used to measure larval ingestion and digestion of diatoms in the laboratory. The epiphytic diatoms used in these studies had a low C:N ratio (6.4) and organic matter content (31%) compared to other potential food resources of larvae in nature. Mean individual ingestion rates increased 6-fold, from 0.0443 mg/d to 0.265 mg/d (dry mass), over a temperature range from 5° to 30°C. Ingestion increased most rapidly between 5° and 15°C but showed a weak relation to temperature from 15° to 30°C. In contrast to ingestion rate, absorption efficiency of larvae was independent of temperature over a 20°C range and averaged 32%. This result was surprising because absorption efficiency should decrease when gut passage time is reduced. These results suggest that there are compensatory changes in digestive processing (e.g., increased enzyme activity) that allow larvae to maintain constant absorption efficiency. This adaptation would benefit eurythermal consumers because the rate of absorption of energy and nutrients would also increase with temperature to help meet higher metabolic demands.",3/1/2001,1/31/2020 22:02,2020-01-31T22:02:08Z,3/31/2014 6:31,68-83,,1,20,,Journal of the North American Benthological Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

California Marine Managed Areas, particularly regulatory marine reserves (MRs), were established to provide legal protection and enhancement of coastal resources and include prohibitions on harvesting intertidal populations. However, the effectiveness of MRs is unclear as enforcement of no-take laws is weak and no regulations protect intertidal species from other detrimental visitor impacts such as trampling. The goal of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine impacts from human visitation on California mussel populations (Mytilus californianus) and mussel bed community diversity; and (2) to investigate the effectiveness of regulatory MRs in reducing visitor impacts on these populations. Surveys of mussel populations and bed-associated diversity were compared: (1) at sites subjected to either high or low levels of human use, and (2) at sites either unprotected or with regulatory protection banning collecting. At sites subjected to higher levels of human visitation, mussel populations were significantly lower than low-use sites. Comparisons of mussel populations inside and outside of regulatory MRs revealed no consistent pattern suggesting that California no-take regulatory reserves may have limited effectiveness in protecting mussel communities. In areas where many people visit intertidal habitats for purposes other than collecting, many organisms will be affected by trampling, turning of rocks, and handling.
